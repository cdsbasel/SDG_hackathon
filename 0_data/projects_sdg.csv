"Christofori, Gerhard M.",NA,Departement Biomedizin / Tumor Biology (Christofori),High content identification and modulation of signaling pathways underlying epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) and cancer metastasis,2013,"Most cancer deaths are due to the systemic dissemination of cancer cells and the formation of secondary tumors (metastasis) in distant organs. Obviously, the migratory and invasive capabilities of cancer cells are critical parameters in the metastatic cascade. 90% of all cancers originate from epithelial tissues, and to leave the primary tumor and to invade into the surrounding tissue tumor cells dissolve their cell-cell contacts and adjust their cell-matrix adhesion sites to a more transient, migratory and invasive mode. Such temporary and reversible phenomenon is known as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a multistage process that involves distinct genetic and epigenetic alterations and leads to metastasizing, tumor-seeding cells with stem cell-like capabilities, potentially cancer stem cells. Employing various cellular models of EMT in vitro and mouse models of cancer in vivo, we have recently observed that EMT is accompanied by a dramatic change in gene expression and the expression and activities of many transcription factors, also indicating a switch in signal transduction pathway activities. Here, we propose to take a focussed approach to identify the signaling pathways and their specific kinase and phosphatase components that functionally contribute to EMT and malignant tumor progression and to modulate the function of these signaling pathways in order to prevent EMT or to differentiate cancer cells into non-malignant, differentiated tumor cells. In particular, we will (1)  identify the signaling pathways and  their specific components that contribute to EMT by performing a high content microscopy screen to interfere with EMT in cultured cells using siRNA libraries against the full mammalian kinome and phosphatome. (2) use a combination of pharmacological and genetic approaches to interfere with specific components of signaling pathways to prevent cancer metastasis in mouse models in vivo. Employing mainly loss of function approaches in a variety of cellular experimental systems in vitro we will characterize the role of signaling pathways during EMT in normal murine mammary epithelial cells and in murine breast cancer cells. In particular, employing state-of-the-art high content microscopy screening with siRNA libraries against all mammalian kinases and phosphatases we will identify the signaling components and signaling pathways that are critical for an EMT to occur. Subsequently, we will employ a combination of pharmacological and RNAi-mediated approaches to interfere with EMT in breast cancer cells in vitro and with tumor metastasis in syngeneic transplantation models of breast cancer in vivo.

The project was initiated in 2007 and started to actively enrol patients in May 2008. The project has been funded, among others, by the SNSF as the core funding agency and currently stays in its 4th funding period. The STCS has evolved into the key tool of transplantation outcome research in Switzerland and has gained rapid international recognition due to the high granularity of data and systematic sampling, resulting in a remarkable scientific output. The key strength that made the STCS a prominent research platform is that the leading national experts from various disciplines collaborate under one roof. Over the last years, the number of scientific projects conducted within the STCS network was continuously increasing, with the 100th project approved by the STCS Scientific committee in 2016. Currently, 41 publications appeared in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Transplant infectious diseases continued to be one of the key areas of interest with a particular track record of critical issues in CMV infections. New areas have emerged, such as airway microbiome assessments in lung transplant recipients, T-cell response studies of BK virus infections in renal transplant recipients or genetic host factors of various infectious diseases phenotypes. Since 2012, the STCS collects antibiotic drug resistance data and first results are expected in 2017. Also recently, the genetic dataset has been enlarged to 3000 patients with genome-wide data and 10 published genetic studies of various phenotypes. The Psychosocial Interest Group (PISG) presented novel studies on body weight evolution, the influence of drug adherence and on workability after renal transplantation. Multiple national and international partners collaborate with the STCS for knowledge- and data exchange, resulting in high-ranked publications. A new level will be achieved with the inter-cohort collaboration with the Danish Persimune cohort and the creation of a metacohort with a common research portfolio. The backbone of the STCS is the unique data structure that allows reflecting every transplant type and the monitoring of even more complicated follow-up scenarios. The data involves clinical -, organ-specific -, laboratory -, psychosocial and behavioural -, genetic and infectious disease contents prospectively collected on a long-term schedule. In parallel, bio-banking of plasma, cell and DNA samples takes place at 0 - 6 - 12 months. Moreover, the STCS is legally mandated to keep a limited-registry of non-consenting patients. By the end of 2016, the STCS centres enrolled 4023 patients with 4187 transplantations, and a total of 4392 transplanted organs. During a maximum follow-up of nearly 9 years, 545 patients died (13.5%) and only 42 patients were lost to follow-up (1%). 93% of all Swiss transplant recipients provided written informed consent to the full STCS datasets, and 99% of consenting patients contributed to the STCS bio-bank. The STCS publishes comprehensive reports for the public and key federal institutions, such as the Federal Office of Public Health, UniMedSuisse and the Swiss Highly Specialized Medicine Board. In 2017, clinical transplant experts conducted in-depth reviews of all datasets and defined the necessary adaptations for the next upgrade (STCS generation 3). Furthermore the genetic working group was created to coordinate funding of extended genotyping and regulate the further use of genetic data. By May 2017, 76 persons were working for the STCS corresponding to 23.8 full-time equivalents being financed by SNF, third party, and own funds. For the next funding period, the STCS will face a number of significant challenges. Patients will be involved more closely to specify their needs and integrate their priorities. In addition to the two randomized trials ongoing and in preparation, additional trials are planned to improve the management of infectious complications post-transplant. The immunological datasets need an update to enable high-quality immunological studies. The current data model will expend towards an interoperability platform to link hospital routine care- and lab data from the centres using the standards proposed by the Swiss Personalized Health Network (SPHN). Conclusion: At the end of four SNF funding periods, the STCS represents a transplant cohort with a patient volume largely above 4000, that experiences large international recognition and that serves a broad variety of clinical, translational, interventional, psychosocial, and health services research. The presented approach to expand the data model towards a data and interoperability platform will prepare the STCS to enter the personalized health area.","Psycosocial, Transplantation, Infectious disease, Graft survival, Quality of life, Epidemiology, Immunology",external_funding,Completed,1201967,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,8,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"Hall, Michael N.","Beerenwinkel, Niko; Christofori, Gerhard M.; Heim, Markus H.",Departement Biozentrum / Biochemistry (Hall),MERiC,2014,"Cancer is a major health problem due to the failure of current therapies to effectively eradicate the disease.  Extensive research over decades has led to the development of therapies that target cancer-specific signaling pathways.  However, tumors escape such therapies by activating compensatory signaling pathways, a process referred to as 'evasive resistance'.  The identities of the alternative signaling pathways and functional interconnections that underlie evasive resistance remain widely unknown.  Elucidating mechanisms of evasive resistance is currently the major challenge in cancer research.  We will integrate cutting-edge clinical, molecular, and computational sciences in a pioneering project to understand the signaling defects that enable tumors to evade therapy.  With its synergistic, interdisciplinary approach, the proposed project is, to our knowledge, unique in Europe and possibly worldwide.

Analysis and Edition of the Greek Textual,2014,"This project takes a new look at an old text. The Bible is a fundamental book for the history of religious beliefs, cultural history, art history as well as many other fields. For centuries it has been read and copied multiple times. Thousands of medieval manuscripts survive. The process of transmission is considered here from a totally new perspective. While biblical manuscripts have so far been largely analysed as witnesses to an original text (""Urtext""), this project approaches each manuscript as a single witness to an act of reading and re-interpreting the text. In recent literary theory, attention has been drawn to ""paratexts"", i.e. all material accompanying a main text. Virtually all biblical manuscripts have some of these features. Examples include brief introductions, biographies, tables of contents, poems, cross-references, prayers, and indexes. However, these paratexts have been neglected by scholars for two reasons: firstly because biblical studies traditionally concentrate on the ""inspired text"" itself; secondly because of the sheer amount of available material, which far exceeds the capacities of a single scholar. Moreover, being very short, these paratexts have often remained below the detection threshold, and since we are dealing with a rich and ""liquid"" transmission, many of them also present a methodological challenge.The project will therefore adopt a new approach. Firstly, it will catalogue all available material in an e Clavis, taking into account recent developments in the fields of structural codicology and digital technology. Secondly, it will develop a set of categories according to which each paratext of the New Testament will be edited according to internal criteria.

"Tan, Kelly",NA,Departement Biozentrum / Physiopathology of basal ganglia neuronal subcircuits (Tan),Rewiring of inhibitory circuitries in Parkinson's disease,2014,"The BG (BG) are a complex network of several central nervous system nuclei, which orchestrate voluntary movements. Among these nuclei, the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) is a GABAergic nucleus of particular interest, as it is the output nucleus of this network. The SNr integrates information received from striatal GABAergic neurons and from excitatory neurons of sub-thalamic nucleus. The SNr then projects to motor subdivisions of the thalamus, the superior colliculus and the pedonculopontine nucleus. Pioneering anatomical studies in rodents and non-human primates have suggested that the SNr is composed of cells with heterogeneous morphology. Heterogeneity of GABAergic neurons has been characterized in the cortex and in the hippocampus. Similar characterization of GABAergic diversity in the SNr will certainly improve our understanding of the BG function. The striatum, the input nucleus of the BG, expresses mainly two types of cells the medium spiny neurons containing dopamine (DA) receptor type 1 (D1R-MSNs) and the DA receptor type 2 (D2R-MSNs). A fine balance between activation of the two MSN pathways allows motor coordination and this balance relies on DA that is released from SNc DA neurons. In Parkinson's disease (PD), a lack of DA in the BG modifies this equilibrium and strongly impairs motor control. This disequilibrium produces the typical motor symptoms of the disease, specifically difficulty in initiating movements, resting tremor, stiffness, slowing of movement and postural instability. The cause of PD remains elusive, but numerous studies have focused on different aspects of the disease such as the genetic factors, the neurodegeneration of SNc DA neurons itself, or the appearance of protein aggregates called Lewy bodies. However, the effect of DA depletion on synaptic connectivity in the BG, and the implications of this altered connectivity on BG function have not been investigated. Such network rewiring in PD has only been studied in the striatum and was shown to lead to disequilibrium between the two pathways. It is therefore likely that DA depletion causes rewiring also in the SNr, which would have important implications for BG function. The goal of this research project is to dissect the microcircuitry of the BG circuitry focusing onto the SNr. Preliminary experiments presented in this project proposal show that the SNr is a heterogeneous GABAergic nucleus and identify the majority of cell types. This inevitably raises the issue that our understanding of the function of the SNr and the BG is over-simplified. Based on this new evidence, we hypothesize that each subpopulation of SNr neurons is differentially involved in a specific circuit to produce a given motor behavior and that the modifications of the specific SNr neuronal circuits leads to the pathological motor symptoms characterizing PD. Hence we focus on: (1)        Dissect the SNr circuitry. a- Investigate the heterogeneity of SNr neurons b- Reveal local SNr circuitry c- Characterize the input/output connectivity of SNr subtype neurons d- Examine the synaptic plasticity rules of the SNr circuitry (2)        Investigate the DA neuromodulation of each SNr subcircuit. (3)        Assess the role of SNr subtype neurons/subcircuits in driving specific motor behaviors. (4)        Characterize SNr circuitry rewiring in mouse models mimicking PD's motor symptoms. The main strategy will rely on the use of cell-specific transgenic mouse lines combined to viral-mediated gene delivery. This will allow the identification and optogenetic manipulation of one SNr subpopulation neuron at a time. In vitro and in vivo electrophysiology will be performed to assess the functional connectivity between SNr neurons and also with their inputs and outputs. DA pharmacological agents will be applied in vitro and in vivo to study DA neuromodulation of the SNr neurons and circuits. Confocal imaging and electron microscopy will represent valuable tools to further confirm neuronal identity and connectivity in baseline conditions and following DA depletion. Finally, motor-based behavioral tests will be combined with optogenetic stimulation of specific SNr neuronal subpopulations to assess their specific role in a precise motor task. This study of the SNr circuitry will offer insights into the still poorly understood physiological mechanisms linking cell-type specificity and synaptic function to BG network activity and behavior. In addition, the study of modifications or rewiring within this system in a model of PD will provide detailed knowledge of the cellular basis of motor disorders, which may lead to novel therapeutic strategies.",optogenetic; Substantia nigra pars reticulata; inhibitory systems; neuronal specificity; Parkinson's disease; pharmacology; basal ganglia; neuromodulation; synaptic transmission,external_funding,Completed,3746910,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,12,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Human communication in face-to-face interaction involves unavoidably both language and the body - be it interaction between family members, colleagues at work, or people in services and health care. Despite this, communication and action have been largely studied by favoring spoken language only. Consequently, the orchestration between language, gesture, gaze, head movements and body postures is still largely ignored. This has also led to a theoretical emphasis that ignores the connection of language to other semiotic resources for communication and underestimates that most of its features are actually strongly associated with and even shaped by situated embodied practice.

"Tan, Kelly",NA,Departement Biozentrum / Physiopathology of basal ganglia neuronal subcircuits (Tan),Remodeling of cognitive circuits in Parkinson's disease,2015,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor symptoms; however, these patients also suffer from cognitive decline and in some cases dementia. Attention, working memory, executive function and information processing are the main affected cognitive domains in PD. These changes may be present as early as the time of diagnosis, and strongly affect the patients' quality of life. An imbalance between acetylcholine (ACh) and dopamine (DA) in the striatum has been shown to mediate some cognitive deficits. And in line with these observations, anticholinergic drugs have proved effective. A brain area of relevance in PD is the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). Our preliminary work provides evidence for its heterogeneity, which dictates a specific ACh receptor expression pattern. In addition, ACh is released locally and by brainstem cholinergic afferences. Based on this new finding, we hypothesize that ACh finely coordinates the activity of the SNr circuitry through the modulation of specific subpopulations of SNr cells. In addition we propose that DA depletion induces a remodeling of SNr circuitry such that ACh modulation is altered, leading to the pathological cognitive symptoms observed in PD. We will use multiple techniques such as confocal imaging to visualize cholinergic receptor expression by SNr cell subtypes, in vitro and in vivo electrophysiology to characterize these cells and their modulation by ACh. Finally a set of behavioral tasks will be performed to measure the impact of such modulation on cognitive processes. Both pharmacological and optogenetic tools will supplement these techniques to selectively manipulate one circuital component at a time. These four aims will be pursued: 1- Identify the cholinergic modulation of SNr neuron subtypes. 2- Dissect the underlying sub-circuits. 3- Assess the role of ACh in cognitive behaviors. 4- Identify the morphological, functional and behavioral alterations of the cognitive loops in a mouse model mimicking PD's symptoms (DA depletion through DA toxin infusion).

In Ghana and Tanzania the major challenges are to understand how to increase and sustain coverage, expand the benefits package for people in the informal sector, and ensure effective coverage with services and financial risk protection to the poorest segments of the population. In addition to the need for more funding, it is important for both countries to develop effective approaches to define eligibility criteria and better identify and target the excluded poor, and to ensure that the rights of citizens who are less likely to be covered are properly addressed. This requires health system governance conducive and responsive to all population groups. Governance in health systems design is rarely studied and little is known about how civil society can improve governance and coverage of social health protection. The project intends to address two related challenges: how can the excluded population be better identified and reached to include them in financing protection mechanisms; how can accountability mechanisms and civil society improve health system governance to support the implementation of inclusive and sustainable social health protection systems. The project will use mixed methods approaches combining collection and analysis of both quantitative, experimental, and qualitative data as well as participatory approaches. It will be composed of two main parts. Part 1 will address the questions of who is excluded from social health protection, why, and the cost and health system implications of including them. It will first investigate the characteristics of the population that is not benefiting from social health protection in Ghana and Tanzania, and the main determinants of exclusion. Secondly, it will assess the health benefits of inclusion in social health protection and which health system factors are crucial. Thirdly, it will identify and validate predictors of inclusion/exclusion that could be used to monitor the performance of social health protection systems. Fourthly, it will investigate in depth the reasons why certain population groups are excluded from social health protection and what could be done to include and engage them. Lastly, it will develop a model to predict the impact of extending social health protection under different scenarios for the health systems in terms of both financial resources and service delivery changes required. Part 2 will focus on evaluating approaches to improve targeting of the poor and governance (with a focus on voice, transparency and accountability) for promoting a more inclusive social health protection. It will first identify the recent experiences and approaches to extend social health protection in Ghana and Tanzania, analyzing them using a health system governance framework. This analysis is expected to reveal opportunities or problems with regard to governance, in particular involving the civil society, in enhancing design and implementation of social health protection.

"Willitsch, Stefan",NA,Departement Chemie / Chemische Physik (Willitsch),Conformationally Controlled Chemistry,2015,"The relationship between structure and reactivity is one of the central tenets of chemistry. In particular, many molecules exhibit structural isomers that interconvert over low barriers through rotations about covalent bonds (conformers). Conformers are the dominant isomers of complex molecules, and the conformation of a molecule can have pronounced effects on its chemical reactivity. Despite the eminent importance of conformational isomers in chemistry, very few studies have been reported thus far charac- terising conformational effects in chemical reactions under single-collision conditions. Consequently, the role of molecular conformations in fundamental reactions is only poorly understood. This striking lack of data reflects the experimental challenges to isolate und control specific conformers.  In a recent proof-of-principle study [Science 342 (2013), 98], we have spatially separated specific con- formers in a molecular beam through electrostatic deflection and directed them at a spatially localized reaction target of cold ions in a trap. This approach allowed us to study conformation-specific effects in ion-molecule reactions under precisely controlled experimental conditions in the gas phase. Here, we pro- pose a wide-ranging research programme aiming at extending our method to neutral reactions and applying it to a range of chemically relevant problems in order to explore the relationship between structure and reactivity in unprecedented detail.

The question arises in conjunction with the interpretation of Swiss accounting rules. Can specific IFRS-rules be generally accepted accounting principles in Swiss law? The research project examines how a norm of international self-regulation can influence Swiss law. Further, it examines whether the differences between the IFRS-rules and the rules of the Swiss Code of Obligation must lead to different representations or whether the optional rules in both the IFRS und the Swiss Code of Obligations allow for a ""dual standard - reporting"". This ""dual standard - reporting"" would simplify the accounting, in particular the consolidation procedure. Further the project addresses the question whether an internal financial reporting system which follows IFRS-rules is compliant with the financial reporting obligations of the board of directors. An internal financial reporting system which follows the accounting rules of the Code of Obligations is admittedly not compliant. If an IFRS reporting system is compliant with the financial reporting obligations of the board of directors this would allow to use the statutory financial reporting as a management tool.

"Voss, Till",NA,Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH) / Gene Regulation (Voss),Understanding Sexual Commitment and Early Differentiation of Malaria Transmission Stages,2015,"Malaria is a devastating infectious disease elicited by protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium. In 2012, malaria caused over 200 million clinical cases and close to 700'000 deaths, mostly among young children in sub-Saharan Africa. Human-to-human transmission of malaria parasites via Anopheles mosquitoes represents the biggest obstacle for efficient malaria control. Infection of the insect vector requires the obligate ingestion of mature sexual precursor forms called gametocytes via the blood meal. Gametocytes are constantly produced during human blood infection where asexually replicating parasites undergo unlimited vegetative growth. During each round of proliferation a small subset of parasites undergo an irreversible switch from vegetative growth to cell cycle exit and sexual differentiation. This provides a continuous source of mature gametocytes, which are the only forms capable of infecting the mosquito vector and are therefore essential for malaria transmission. The regulatory basis of this cell fate decision process has long remained one of the largest mysteries in the biology of malaria parasites. Recent seminal work now uncovered AP2-G, a key transcription factor essential for gametocyte commitment. The switch from asexual proliferation to gametocyte differentiation is controlled through an epigenetic mechanism that regulates the expression of AP2-G. In asexual parasites, the ap2-g locus is silenced by heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), an evolutionary conserved regulator of heritable gene silencing. Conditional depletion of HP1 is sufficient to activate AP2-G expression and to cause an irreversible switch to sexual differentiation. The main goal of this research proposal is to elucidate the molecular basis of the sexual conversion switch in P. falciparum, which causes the most virulent form of malaria in humans. I will realise this by pursuing three major objectives designed to identify the mechanisms responsible for heritable silencing and activation of the cell fate decision factor PfAP2-G and to investigate the role of PfAP2-G in early differentiation of malaria transmission stages. I propose a multi-faceted approach combining innovative reverse genetics methods with high throughput sequencing and proteomics technology and automated fluorescence imaging. This will identify regulatory factors and processes involved in the mechanism establishing silenced chromatin at the pfap2-g locus and in the upstream molecular pathway triggering activation of PfAP2-G expression. Furthermore, I will elucidate the direct consequences of PfAP2-G activation on the transcriptional and chromatin landscape in early gametocytes. The anticipated results will deliver unprecedented insight into this crucial and unique cell fate decision processes and will uncover new possibilities for the discovery and development of transmission-blocking drugs. Importantly, since pfap2-g is conserved in all Plasmodium species the acquired knowledge will most likely also be valid for other species infecting humans including P. vivax.",NA,external_funding,Completed,2985208,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,20,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Member States' Preferences for Economic and Financial Integration,2015,"The euro area crisis demonstrated how weak economic policy coordination and loose fiscal oversight could destabilize a monetary union. To prevent a recurrence of the crisis, economists, political actors and the ""Blueprint"" of the European Commission are asking for the construction of a deep and genuine economic and monetary union with reinforced governance architecture - beyond the recently adopted mechanisms.   Research Questions Which member states pushed for monetary, economic and fiscal integration, and why? What kind of economic and political integration model was advocated, and by which member state? How and to what extent did political economy interests drive member states' preferences? How did international pressure and constitutional constraints influence governments' preference formation? What are we to expect for future integration, regarding the EMU and the EU in general? Are the member states' preferences poised for further deepening and supranational governance, or rather for intergovernmental coordination with the involvement of the Commission, the European Court of Justice and the European Central Bank? Finally, do they still aim at the principle of inclusiveness, or is this principle rather substituted by a strategy of differentiated integration?   Research Strategy For studying these questions, our project proposes to investigate member states governments' stances o economic and fiscal integration issues - such as common economic governance proposals, fiscal surveillance measures, or a permanent fiscal transfer system. To this end, we aim to conduct approximately 165 semi-structured interviews with decision makers in all member states and EU organs and to analyze primary and secondary sources on intergovernmental negotiations. Our core argument builds on the comparative political economy literature as well as liberal intergovernmentalism and claims that domestic political, economic and fiscal characteristics explain member states governments' preferences for different fiscal and economic integration proposals. For the empirical investigation, we propose a mixed method research strategy that builds on three consecutive steps. First, we analyze intergovernmental negotiations on fiscal and economic integration and identify the positions of the member states' governments. Second, we quantitatively evaluate to what extent the member states' positions reflect domestic political, economic and fiscal characteristics. Finally, we enrich the quantitative analysis with case studies for a more nuanced understanding of the causal chain from domestic economic, fiscal and political characteristics to governments' preferences. The final part of the project will provide a detailed political feasibility analysis, by which we discuss future economic and fiscal integration scenarios and assess their likelihood based on the project's findings. This analysis will be complemented by a full-fledged legal study that investigates the legal context on the EU level, as well as in all member states. This will be of particular importance because legal questions must be taken into account for the successful implementation of any economic and fiscal integration proposals.","European Union, economic and monetary union, negotiation, preference, strategy",external_funding,Completed,3603109,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,22,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Three nodes will be trapped-ion systems, each equipped with an optical cavity for enhanced photon collection and a register of ions with quantum-logic capabilities. On-demand photons, emitted by and entangled with one or more ion in each node, will be distributed in an inter-node optical fiber network. The fourth node will be an ensemble-based quantum memory, capable of multimode quantum light storage, on-demand read out and interfac ing with the trapped ion platforms.  Our first scientific objective is to develop and demonstrate directly scalable methods for the long- distance distribution of entanglement between quantum-logic capable memories. For this, the ion-trap platform will be developed to achieve near-deterministic photon collection, entanglement distribution faster than any decoherence rate and broad control over the photons' temporal and spectral properties. The solid-state platform will be developed to provide on-demand quantum networking capabilities and photon compatibility with the ion platform. Fundamentally new net- work protocols and error correction schemes will be pursued that exploit our strong light-matter interactions and quantum logic capabilities, and that aim for future efficient networks over inter- continental distances. Using these tools and techniques, we will experimentally demonstrate: 1) A distributed and error-protected ion-trap quantum repeater, via simultaneous three-node entangle- ment. 2) An ion-ensemble hybrid network that exploits the powerful properties of each system. 3) Quantum networking between all physical platforms at the prime telecom wavelength, allowing internode spacings of tens of kilometers and integration with the telecommunications industry.

"Filges, Isabel",NA,Bereich Kinder- und Jugendheilkunde (Klinik) / Medizinische Genetik (Miny),Massively parallel Sequencing for gene discovery in lethal fetal disorders,2015,"The announcement of a serious or even lethal condition during pregnancy or at birth is a devastating experience for the parents and the health professionals involved. The demand for the determination of the cause is high, not only for psychological reasons, but also for determining pregnancy and perinatal management, recurrence risks as well as counseling for subsequent pregnancies. Malformations and genetic disorders are the leading cause of infant mortality in the developed countries accounting for more than one third of cases; more than 70% present with organ malformations. Today, major, also potentially lethal, malformations are often already detected prenatally during ultrasound examination. The prevalence of malformations during fetal development is even higher, because a proportion of these pregnancies will not survive until birth. In about 10-15% the genetic origin is due to chromosome anomalies including submicroscopic anomalies detected by chromosomal microarrays. In the remaining patients genetic testing for mutations in single genes can only be offered if a clinical diagnosis of a specific disorder is suspected. Novel high-throughput next generation sequencing technologies have now enabled the discovery of many novel genes in children with developmental impairments. However, only little attention has been paid to using these sequencing strategies for gene identification in human malformation syndromes that are lethal in utero or at birth despite their frequency and their importance in pregnancy and newborn health care. Aim: In this project we will use massively parallel genomic sequencing for gene identification in deceased fetuses and newborns with multiple malformations of unknown cause after normal chromosomal array analysis. The general goal of this project is to identify disease genes where mutations lead to autosomal recessive forms of these lethal conditions. Hypotheses: We test the hypotheses that (1) massively parallel sequencing of all protein-coding regions in the genome (exome sequencing) can identify novel genes by detecting the mutations that cause malformations in fetuses and newborns in whom such etiological factors exist, that (2) autosomal recessive mutations are an important cause of early human lethality and 3) the comparison of human and animal morphology - cross-species phenotyping - is an important means to validate novel potentially causal genes. Methods: We select families in which at least two children (and at least one girl) died during pregnancy or after birth because of their malformations. The malformation pattern can be correlated to a particular developmental pathway in embryogenesis. Genes with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations will be considered candidate genes. In order to investigate the causality of mutations, the expected inheritance of these recessive candidate mutations will be confirmed in the family, and the absence of these variants in normal populations will be confirmed by analysis of the publicly available genome sequences of unaffected individuals. A critical aspect of this project is genotype-phenotype correlations of candidate genes in which we will include developmental pathway analysis and cross-species phenotyping using animal models. Relevance: Malformations and genetic disorders are the leading cause of prenatal and newborn mortality in the developed countries. Knowledge of the impact of genetic diseases on mortality is important for the integration of preventive measures and health care strategies to care appropriately for patients and their families. Our approach will provide a means of obtaining the genetic cause for fatal malformation syndromes for whom this is not currently available. We expect to discover previously unknown autosomal recessive genes, to discover novel mutations in known genes which have not been yet associated with fetal or perinatal human death and to describe novel prenatally observed syndromes which have not been recognized before. The comparison of human and animal morphology allows validating genes involved in those unrecognized and so far neglected conditions. Complementary to the current large scale international efforts to characterize lethal malformations and causal genes in mice we will focus on increasing our knowledge about normal and abnormal human development. The genes identified may also serve as candidate genes for the cause of similar non-lethal conditions through different mutational mechanisms which would not have been recognized otherwise. Ultimately, families and health care professionals will benefit from novel care and treatment approaches based on the research into these biological mechanisms.",genotype-phenotype correlation; Medical Genetics; children/families; exome sequencing; gene identification; Malformations; fetal disorders,external_funding,Completed,6332,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,25,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Mediators are nolonger supposed to only bring a conflict to an end, they are also asked to integratecertain norms into mediation processes. However, although the role and diffusion ofnorms have been widely researched in international relations and peacebuildingliterature, the same does not count for the field of mediation. While the conditionsunder which mediation leads to a sustainable agreement have been assessed, the roleof mediators in norm diffusion has only been treated in a largely prescriptive way inpolicy debates. This is surprising given the fact that mediation is at the core of a widerpeacebuilding process.This project seeks to shed light on the role of mediators in norm diffusion by asking towhat extent mediators are norm entrepreneurs defined by Finnemore and Sikkink(1998: 895) as actors who ""attempt to convince a critical mass of [actors] to embracenew norms"". More specifically, it addresses the questions of what norms belong to thenormative framework for mediation processes; whether mediators promote and imitatenorms and how; and which norms have been internalized in mediation processes.Thereby, the project responds to three biases in current research on norm diffusion.First, it also allows insights into those norms that have not diffused in contrast toearlier research which has largely neglected instances of non-diffusion. Second, normdiffusion will neither be seen as a priori positive or negative compared to currentanalyses which often portray it as inherently positive. Third, the project allows foragency of actors while earlier research mainly focused on the influence of the structureon agents.Methodologically, the project is based on a combination of case study andprocess-tracing. Three cases of mediators are chosen which are mandated by the mosttypical actors in the mediation field: an intergovernmental organization (the UnitedNations (UN)), a regional organization (the African Union (AU)) and a state(Switzerland). On the basis of these three cases, a two-level analysis is conducted.First, and most importantly, the project assesses causal processes at the within-caselevel focusing on the agency of mediators. It does this through process-tracing becauseit allows for an in-depth description of a trajectory of change, namely the process ofnorm diffusion, and analyzes closely the sequences of independent, dependent, andintervening variables. Second, it conducts a comparison at the cross-case levelexamining how the role of mediators as norm entrepreneurs varies between the threecases.

Current strategies, including cell-based treatments, still have major drawbacks and show unsatisfactory long-term results due to inferior quality of repair tissue as compared to native cartilage. This proposal aims at testing new promising therapies for cartilage repair in the knee based on the use of nasal chondrocytes (instead of typically used articular chondrocytes) and on the implantation of a tissue (instead of a cell-based graft). The main objectives are: (1)  To compare the clinical efficacy of a tissue therapy (nasal chondrocyte-derived engineered cartilage, NC-TECI) with that of a cell therapy (nasal chondrocyte delivery from a matrix, NC-MACI) for cartilage repair. A multicenter, prospective, phase II trial will be conducted in four clinical centers with enrollment of 108 patients. This trial will be build on a phase I study demonstrating the safety and feasibility of NC-TECI for treatment of traumatic articular cartilage injuries. The phase II study will give an indication about the role of graft maturation on the clinical outcome. The clinical efficacy will be measured through a 10 points increase in the KOOS score (primary outcome) reflecting improvement in patients 'pain and knee function. (2)  To extend the range of potential clinical indications of NC-TECI and NC-MACI to so far untreatable (pre)osteoarthritic lesions.

Technology shapes Beckett's output in crucial ways on three levels: it plays a pivotal role in the production of his work, appears prominently on the diegetic plane of his plays, and shapes the textual and medial organization of his texts and productions. Yet it has only recently been recognized that Beckett is a pre-eminent multimedia artist whose innovations influence media art to the present day. The excitement of this recognition is coupled with a challenge posed by the realization that much of the technology, which the aesthetics of Beckett's media works depend on, belongs to the past. Since the reflection on the effects of media technologies on culturally established norms of representation define Beckett's work in fundamental ways, this historical distance creates the need for technologically informed re-readings of a representative cross-section of Beckett's work in several media. At the same time, the significance of the project can be understood in broader terms. For Beckett is a privileged observer of a medial transition whose subtle artistic negotiations of newly emerging systems of cultural exchange, which also define our present, offer unique insights into how the epistemological and anthropological parameters of culture change. Our project applies a comprehensive multimedial perspective to Beckett's work, combining media archaeology with close reading, transformational analysis, and media- and genre-historical contextualization. Our main analytical focus is on Beckett's creative combination of varying medial configurations and communication paradigms, including writing, electromagnetic sound recording, radio transmission, cinematography, and audiovisual broadcasting. In staging these combinations, Beckett reflects upon and enacts the radical impact that medial and technological developments had on basic human activities such as reading, speaking, listening, seeing, and remembering. In Beckett's plays, dismembered organs (Mouth), disembodied human faculties (Voice), media fields (Music, Word), and apparatuses (Tape) are dramatic characters that attain a status equal to human beings. Beckett not only thematizes technology and uses it in the production of his work; he also abuses apparatuses in the sense that he disrupts their functioning by staging processes of interference (remediation, mimicry, hybridization) between them to expose how they shape perception and cognition. In the framework of our project, we analyze a range of materials available in The Samuel Beckett Collection of the University of Reading Library, some of which have not been discussed by scholars, while this body of material has not been researched from a sustained media-theoretical perspective yet. Much of the project's innovative thrust stems from its sustained effort to bring together some of the most powerful voices in contemporary anglophone Beckett scholarship and German media analysis (especially media archaeology but also Luhmannian systems theory and historical epistemology) to think anew the interplay between media, materiality, aisthesis, and the discursive processes in Beckett's work. Our ultimate aim is to rethink Beckett's oeuvre as a complex, dynamic media system.","literary studies, screen works, media archaeology, Samuel Beckett, multimediality, stage plays, materiality, radio plays, mediality",external_funding,Completed,3242114,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,34,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Currently, there exists no established curative or protective treatment, and they constitute a major and increasing health problem and, in consequence, an economic burden in aging populations globally. Parkinson's disease (PD), following Alzheimer's disease (AD), is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide, estimated to occur in approximately 1% of population above 60 and at least in 3% in individuals above 80 years of age. In Switzerland, about 15'000 persons are diagnosed with PD. In addition to motor signs, which due to recent medical progress can be treated satisfactorily in most cases, non-motor symptoms and signs severely affect the well-being of patients. They include mood disorders, psychosis, cognitive decline, disorders of circadian rhythms, as well as vegetative and cardiovascular dysregulation. Neurodegeneration in PD progresses for years before clinical diagnosis is possible, at which time e.g. 80% of dopaminergic neurons in the Substantia nigra are lost already. Therefore, any clinical targeting disease modification, prognosis and personalized treatment including guiding the indication for deep brain stimulation (DBS) requires reliable and valid biomarkers. The main goal of this research project is the identification of a pertinent set of genetic andneurophysiological markers for diagnosis and early risk assessment of PD-dementia. Our approach has a distinct interdisciplinary basis, in that it fosters close collaborations between physicians, neuroscientists, psychiatrists, psychologists, computer scientists and statisticians. Based on current research findings we postulate that a combination of (1) quantitative electroencephalographic measures (QEEG, e.g. frequency power and connectivity patterns and network analysis), (2) genetic biomarkers (e.g. MAPT, COMT, GBA, APOE) and (3) neuropsychological assessment improves early recognition and monitoring of cognitive decline in PD. To test this hypothesis, this project proposes an interdisciplinary long-term study of patients diagnosed with PD without signs of dementia, among them a subgroup of patients undergoing DBS.The workup of the proposed study includes collection of clinical, neuropsychological, neurophysiological and genotyping data at the baseline, as well as at 3, 4 and 5 years follow-ups. Sophisticated statistical models that can deal with noisy measurements, missing values and heterogeneous data types will be used to extract the best combination of biomarkers and neuropsychological variables for diagnosis and prediction of prognosis of PD-dementia.

High tibial osteotomy (HTO) is a well-accepted therapy for patients with knee OA and varus alignment aimed at re-establishing a more even distribution of ambulatory load between the affected medial knee compartment and the lateral knee compartment. However, the survival rate of HTO is only around 75% after 5 years. There is some evidence that the change in ambulatory load after HTO may be more relevant than the post-operative static alignment although this relationship has not yet been investigated. Because of the large changes in ambulatory load with HTO, we propose that HTO may serve as a valuable model for studying the effect of changes in ambulatory load on in vivo cartilage mechanobiology in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Our previous work has shown that serum biomarkers for cartilage increase after a 30-minute walking exercise (termed 'walking stress test') and indicated that these changes may be associated with the accumulated ambulatory load during the test. Our overall hypothesis is that a sudden ambulatory load reduction (caused by HTO) leads to changes in cartilage biology that delay or reverse osteoarthritic processes determining the clinical outcome and representing an in vivo model for assessing cartilage mechanosensitivity. We will address the following specific aims:Specific Aim 1: To test the relationship between changes in ambulatory load pre-HTO to 6 months post-HTO, static alignment 6 months post-HTO and changes in clinical scores pre-HTO to 12 months post-HTO.Specific Aim 2: To test the relationship between magnitude of ambulatory load (modified by HTO) during a walking stress test and the change in serum concentrations of cartilage biomarkers.Specific Aim 3: To test the relationship between changes in cartilage biomarkers during a walking stress test 6 months after HTO and functional outcome 12 months post-HTO.Patients with medial compartment knee OA and varus alignment will be clinically assessed (including mechanical axis measurement from radiographs) and complete questionnaires on physical function prior to medial opening wedge HTO. Patients will complete a walking stress test with blood sampling (30 minutes walking, 5.5 hours sitting) to assess load-induced changes in serum biomarker concentrations (COMP, MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9, C2C/CPII), and undergo gait analysis to assess the external knee adduction moment. Once full load bearing is achieved (6 weeks after HTO), the mechanical axis will be measured from radiographs. Patients will complete the questionnaires and a second walking stress test with blood sampling and undergo gait analysis 6 months after HTO. At the 12-month follow-up, subjects will complete the questionnaires.The results of this study can be considered as proof-of-concept of a potential prognostic test (walking stress test) for cartilage degeneration. To date, the use of cartilage biomarkers for OA diagnostics and prognostics is limited in part because of the large inter-subject variation in serum markers. A direct relationship between ambulatory load and cartilage metabolism assessed as degradation to synthesis ratio would allow developing novel load-modifying interventions and evaluating the efficacy of existing interventions. Moreover, a predictive relationship between load-induced changes in cartilage biomarkers 6 months post-HTO and functional outcome another 6 months later would suggest that the stress test may be a promising prognostic tool for detecting degenerative cartilage processes. Overall, a model for measuring in vivo mechanosensitivity may also provide unique insights into in vivo cartilage degeneration and regeneration processes in healthy subjects, after injuries or in patients with musculoskeletal disease.",NA,external_funding,Completed,3000687,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,43,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

These mechanisms include glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress and alterations of the gut microbiota. Interestingly, all of these mechanisms are associated with inflammatory response. Clinical studies have demonstrated that anti-inflammatory treatments including IL-1- antagonism, salsalate and probably TNF-antagonism improve glucose metabolism. Some anti-inflammatory treatments may be more effective at improving insulin secretion, while others primarily enhance insulinsensitivity. Furthermore, there are different mechanisms that engage different branches of immune response during the course of diabetes. Given the heterogeneity of the disease and the complexity of the inflammatory response, optimal anti-inflammatory strategies are a challenge and studies in humans have yielded variable results. However, inflammation is not in itself a disease but a manifestation of a disease. It may have beneficial effects allowing for adaptation to the metabolic stress. Increasing evidence suggests physiological and beneficial effects of the inflammation (called protective immune response) in the adaptive process of increased insulin secretion and reduced insulin resistance. A metabolic inflammatory response consists of four components: inflammatory inducers (such as nutrients), cell sensors (such as macrophages, dendritic cells), inflammatory mediators (such as T cells) and the target tissues (adipose tissue, liver and pancreas) that are affected by inflammatory mediators. The time line of events and the molecular mechanisms that integrate the inflammatory response with metabolic homeostasis at the tissue and systemic levels are still to be characterized in T2D. Recently, we discovered that inflammatory pathways controlled by Interferon Regulatory Factor 5 (IRF5) in macrophages (the sensor cells) orchestrate the immune response towards a pro-diabetogenic program (Dalmas et al. Nature Medicine in press). Interfering with IRF5 pathways (IRF5 macrophage specific KO mice) lead to modification of the innate and adaptive response leading to a healthier metabolic status. Extensive characterisation of the IRF5-dependent immune response is required for a better understanding of physiological (protective) versus pathological immune programs involved in T2D (mouse studies). These immune programs will also be validated in different clinical situations (human studies) ie: weight loss, exercise and immune-therapy (IL-6 modulation) known to improve diabetes and reduce inflammation. The overall objective of the proposed project is to reveal the physiologic role of inflammation dependent of IRF5 pathways in the adaptation to metabolic stress linked to T2D. Understanding the physiological and the pathological role of the immune system may allow designing personalized treatments promoting a beneficial immune status in patients with T2D.","Diabète, Inflammation",external_funding,Completed,3343906,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,44,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Einige davon sind einfach, doch bei anderen fällt die Wahl schwer, zum Beispiel weil jede Entscheidungsalternative Gutes und Schlechtes mit sich bringt. In diesem Forschungsprojekt untersuchen wir, wie in Situationen der Unentschiedenheit das Treffen von Entscheiden unterstützt werden kann. Angelehnt an die Begrifflichkeit in den Naturwissenschaften bezeichnen wir dies als ""Katalysieren"" von Entscheiden. Inhalt und Ziel des Forschungsprojekts Während der Begriff ""Entscheide katalysieren"" auf den ersten Blick stutzig machen mag, sind den meisten Menschen eigene Beispiele bekannt. Unentschieden zwischen zwei Alternativen werfen sie beispielsweise eine Münze-doch wenn diese fällt, sind sie erstaunlicherweise mit dem Ergebnis zufrieden oder nicht, so als wären sie zuvor doch nicht unentschieden gewesen. Auf Ebene psychologischer Prozesse stösst der Münzwurf etwas an (katalysiert den Entscheid), indem er die Perspektive von einer offenen Wahlsituation zu einer konkreten Entscheidung verändert. Dabei kann es zur veränderten Gewichtung von Informationen kommen, und/oder zur stärkeren Berücksichtigung von affektiven und kognitiven Gefühlen. Wir untersuchen, ob und wann diese Veränderungen dazu führen, dass Menschen (gute) Entscheide treffen. Wissenschaftlicher und gesellschaftlicher Kontext Dieses Projekt leistet Beiträge zur Grundlagen- und Anwendungsforschung in der Sozial- und Entscheidungspsychologie. Es wird untersucht, wie Entscheide trotz Unentschiedenheit erleichtert werden können. Unsere Befunde sind gesellschaftlich relevant, weil Menschen viele Entscheide treffen und dabei häufig zwischen Alternativen mit unterschiedlichen Vor- und Nachteilen unentschieden sind, und weil durch den Aufschub solcher Entscheide hohe Kosten entstehen können (z.B. Altersvorsorge). Individuals are faced with a multitude of decisions every day. Some decisions are clear-cut, but for others, individuals are torn between options. The present project investigates the pioneering notion of catalysing decisions. The term catalysis is borrowed from the natural sciences and is here used in the conceptual meaning of initiating, accelerating, or guiding the selectivity of the decision process. A catalyst is conceived of as a means or setting that renders a decision quasi-factual, that is, as if decided. Examples of catalysts include, but are not limited to: tossing a coin, counting-out rhymes, throwing a dice, considering a decision as already made, etc. While more than one option is usually viable before a decision is made, the catalyst presets a choice and thereby moves the decision from the realm of hypotheticality to the here and now. This change in psychological distance causes critical changes on the level of cognitive construal and of feelings. As a result, content information that existed but was not considered before may come to the forefront; moreover, feelings may be stronger and different in nature. Together these changes allow for a different perspective, which may help to arrive at a decision where individuals were undecided beforehand.

This umbrella organization with its many international bodies can be considered as 'third place' with a specific staff culture that effects inclusion or exclusion and eventually impinge on the employment success when it comes to gaining new staff members. Thus, following the agent perspective, this research study ultimately asks for the characteristics of this closed system of the United Nations and how these cross-cultural relations and interactions influence professional careers and biographies. More precisely, the main purpose of this research is to analyze the everyday performances (hereinafter referred to as the 'ritualized cross-cultural interactions') based on how they mold work culture or identity of employees in UN organizations. It is presumed that this particular culture and the cultural practices, in other words the 'habitus of international life and work', shape the careers and biographies of the employees and, to a critical extent, the biographies of their family members.  The research subject includes a multi-site research perspective and applies a multi-method approach that entails as a combination of participative observation, qualitative interviews with relevant agents seen as representative case studies and a discursive data analysis of the organization's publicity focused on human resources issues.  This research study will provide a critical analysis of a trans-globally acting organization seen as a particular area of work and aims to reveal findings about cultural practices (ritualized cross-cultural interactions) in the webs of bureaucracy and diplomacy. For a better understanding of the dynamics of what can be framed as ´international careers´, this research sets out to investigate on the habitus of transnational life and work.

Alpine grassland provides essential ecosystem services such as erosion control, forage production and high water yield, all teleconnected to adja-cent valleys and lowlands. Unusual timing in snowmelt (too early and too late) in combina-tion with summer drought, as a result of climatic warming, will exert so far unexplored changes in state variables, ecosystem services of these vast grasslands and will have a socie-tal impact. Snow cover protects plants from frost and prevents soil freezing, thus, allowing continuous microbial activity (mineralization) throughout the long alpine winter. A shift in the timing of snowmelt will (1) disrupt the close coupling between the provision of soil nutrients and the plant nutrient demands and (2) will cause soils to dry out faster, espe-cially, when followed by a summer drought, inducing plant stress. We will establish a unique snow removal/addition experiment in an alpine grassland at 2500 m a.s.l. in the Swiss central Alps.

"Ebert, Dieter",NA,Departement Umweltwissenschaften / Evolutionary Biology (Ebert),Testing predictions of Red Queen coevolution,2016,"Testing predictions of Red Queen coevolution, by Dieter Ebert, Universita&#776;t Basel  SUMMARY It is believed that many biological phenomena (e.g. the evolution of sex, Batesian mimicry, and immune response) have evolved as a consequence of host-parasite coevolution. The leading hypothesis for such coevolution is based on time-lagged negative frequency dependent selection (NFDS), also known as Red Queen coevolution. Evidence from population genetics (e.g. high genetic diversity and balancing selection at disease loci) is consistent with the idea that NFDS drives coevolution in host-parasite systems, but other models of coevolution (e.g., selective sweeps) cannot be easily excluded. Here I propose to test the predictions of the Red Queen coevolution hypothesis by analysis of hosts and parasite dynamics in one well-characterized population. In this Daphnia magna population we observe yearly strong epidemics of the bacterial parasite Pasteuria ramosa. I propose to test the hypothesis that coevolution in this system is driven by NFDS.  Subproject A aims to identify the host genes that prevent parasite attachment in one particular population (""The Swisspond""), which has yearly strong epidemics of Pasteuria ramosa. We plan to compare different host-genotypes by sequencing from each resistotype multiple genomes and conduct genome-wide association mapping. In a next step we aim to pinpoint the exact genes responsible for the resistance polymorphism by employing molecular tools (CRISPR/Cas9) to knock down candidate genes in the regions of interest. The cloned offspring of the knock down genotypes will be tested for phenotypic effects in response to multiple parasite clones.  Subproject B continues our efforts to find the infectivity genes in the bacterial pathogen Pasteuria. This parasite has now been fully sequenced and genomes from different isolates with known infection characteristics will be compared. As a further step we plan to do a proteomics approach, to identify the proteins which are expressed on the spore surface and which are responsible for the attachment of the parasite to the host. Subproject C aims to uncover the genetic interaction matrix between host and parasite genotypes. Host and parasite isolates from the field will be cloned in the laboratory and the mode of inheritance of resistance will be worked out by conducting genetic crosses among hosts. At the same time, infected hosts will be collected across the course of an epidemic in the field and will be genotypes for candidate genes at host resistance loci and parasite infectivity loci. This ""co-genotyping"" will allow estimating the strength of genetic host-parasite interactions during natural epidemics and enable us to estimate the strength of selection acting on different genotypes.  Expected value of the research: This research aims to provide a convincing case study on the validity and predictions of the Red Queen coevolution hypothesis, offering urgently needed genetic data for theoretical and empirical research in evolution, epidemiology and disease biology.

It is embedded in a fresh perspective onto the material culture of the early modern period which has produced a distinguished historiography in recent years. We argue that it is important to address the vibrancy of matter itself, that is to say the ability of things to exceed their status as mute objects through their material properties. We will ask, how, in a particular culture and emotional community, were interactions with particular materials valorised and which emotions did they elicit? And how did the interplay of matter and emotion shape individual and group identities? Historians of emotions have firmly established that each period is distinguished by different emotional styles, communities and mandatory regimes. However, the role of objects as constitutive of subjectivities and emotions has only recently begun to attract scholarly attention. By taking current debates into new directions, this project seeks to formulate nuanced accounts of agentive materialities in relation to early modern social life, politics and cultures. To achieve this goal the project will approach 'the material' through four themes - gold, glass, veils and feathers - in relation to specific individuals as well as interpretative communities. These four types of materialities and object groups were each attached to different sensory regimes and valorisations, which underwent significant changes during this period. Our focus on materials and their relation to values and affects means working through a series of research questions, which will benefit especially from interdisciplinary collaboration. We work from the premise that subjectivities in this period emerged in relation to an ever-increasing object world. Artefacts embodied and produced values, they reflected and shaped emotional desires as well as bodily sensations. As historians and art historians have begun to show, artists and other creators and makers in the late medieval and early modern periods often played with, used and interrogated materiality. They were open to experiencing the qualities and histories of matter not in metaphorical terms but as potential carriers of sentient feeling. This dialogue with matter vigorously continued in the Reformation and confessional age. These redefined the spiritual status of matter rather than obliterating it, and we need to gain a much better understanding of how this was so. Almost everyone in late medieval and early modern society in some way lived from or experimented with transforming matter, through their labour, interests or quotidian practices. At the same time many of these societies were involved in a continuous struggle with materiality and its threats to societal order. A long-lasting conflict between tradition and fashion grew from these tensions, a conflict that remained unresolved throughout the Early Modern period. A crucial aspect of these insights is therefore that art and craft in this period was no frozen 'tradition' or just the realm of specific experts - the early modern period was a made world and a world in the making. Our methodologies will combine a qualitative analysis of serial records and ego-documents with object-led approaches. The cooperation of academics with curators and makers allows for fresh perspectives in the field and in turn impacts on museum exhibitions or displays. This proposed research group has five overarching aims: 1. to rethink the category of materiality. 2. to connect the history of material culture to the history of emotions. 3. to shape religious milieus and cultures and to add protestant as well as converso-cultures into a European topography of Early Modern material culture dominated by catholic cultures of Renaissance Italy. 4. to enhance the communication and collaboration between the academy and museums. 5. to strengthen the visibility of Swiss research in the largely Anglo-American research debate on material history in the early modern world.","emotional cultures, Early Modern, fashion and tradition, Reformation, innovation, values, craft, Renaissance, materiality, identities, gold, glas, veils, feathers",external_funding,Completed,3242173,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,50,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Patients with breast cancer die unequivocally because of the development of incurable distant metastases and not because of symptoms related to the primary site. Understanding the complex, yet fundamental mechanisms driving breast cancer metastasis is hence critical to develop therapies tailored for this disease. Cancer cells that leave the primary tumor site and are transported through the circulation to distant organs are referred to as circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and they hold the key to understanding the biology of blood-borne metastasis. CTCs are extraordinarily rare in patients with cancer (approximately one CTC per billion normal blood cells), and their isolation is greatly dependent upon technological constraints. However, recent breakthrough advances in microfluidics technology have made it possible for the first time to analyze human CTCs with great precision, revealing unexpected features. For instance, our recent findings showed that CTC-clusters, held together by interepithelial cell-cell junctions, are precursors of breast cancer metastasis (Aceto et al., Cell, 2014). This represents a previously unappreciated and potentially targetable mechanism of cancer dissemination. Further, our preliminary data obtained with single cell resolution RNA sequencing of CTCs from breast cancer patients with bone metastasis, highlighted the expression of specific candidate genes that could explain breast cancer tropism to the bone as a primary metastatic site. Altogether, our observations lead to two major goals. First, we aim to identify and target those cell-cell junction components required for CTC-clustering and metastasis. Second, we aim to apply single cell resolution analysis of human CTCs to dissect major signals driving breast cancer to specific metastatic sites (i.e. bone, lung and brain).

One of the outstanding problems currently is to provide precise, robust and reliable tools for parasite diagnostics in rural and resource limited settings. While cases of high parasite density can be detected by microscopy and rapid diagnostics tests, many asymptomatic infections often escape detection by the tests currently available. These sub-patent infections are increasingly acknowledged as a previously neglected reservoir for onwards transmission. In parallel, with reduced transmission intensity, the proportion of individuals seeking healthcare for acute febrile illness not caused by malaria will increase. This is not being addressed adequately in the rural Amazon region, where health systems are precarious and the only health diagnostic tool provided at most health posts is for malaria infection. Previous research performed in the region have already pointed to the great diversity of infectious agents causing acute fever, from arbovirus to bacteria, at the same time that studies have shown the usefulness of clinical algorithms for the improvement of management of febrile cases.Addressing these two major issues is of great importance for the enhancement of public health actions and healthcare provided in the Amazon region. Both implications of declining malaria transmission deserve to be further investigated.Aims: Two lines of research will address present shortfalls in the clinical and laboratory-based diagnosis of malaria. The proposal aims to:(i) investigate the aetiology of acute febrile illness (AFS) amongst children seeking for healthcare at peri-urban and rural health centres in the Amazon region with the focus of generating clinical and laboratorial algorithms for case management and referral to secondary and tertiary centres. (ii) gain knowledge on the prevalence of very low density asymptomatic malaria infections that are below the detection limit of standard diagnosis in the field (microscopy, rapid diagnostic tests) and investigate the relevance of low density infections for onward transmission. Methods (i) Previous research performed at the Swiss TPH and other groups on the aetiology of fever in malaria-endemic regions in Africa and Asia will guide the development of a research protocol to characterize the aetiology of AFS in the Amazon region.(ii) Ultra-sensitive molecular methods will be applied for the diagnosis of P. falciparum and P. vivax. Archived samples from a cross sectional survey in which the Brazilian PI participated in the Amazonas region as well as currently collected samples from response surveillance (indicator cases and individual from the same household and neighbouring houses up to 2.5 km distance) will be analysed by highly sensitive quantitative PCR and reverse transcription PCR. (iii) Membrane and direct blood feeding assays performed with blood samples from sub-microscopic but qPCR-positive household contacts will be conducted in Manaus using Anopheles aquasalis colonies at the laboratory of collaborator M. Lacerda, with the aim to assess the infectivity of low density infections and their potential for transmission. Expected outcomes-A description of the fever-related syndromes and associated causes amongst patients seeking health care in the Amazon. As malaria transmission intensity decreases, a higher proportion of febrile cases not caused by Plasmodium sp. has to be expected. Some of these fevers are potentially severe, e.g. arbovirus infections such as dengue or bacterial diseases causing sepsis.

A vast amount of methane is produced and stored in natural wetlands and lakes. The multiple factors that can control aerobic methane oxidation in these environments are still not fully understood. We propose an international, interdisciplinary research program between the Universities of Basel and Vienna, in which hyphenated HPLC-MS, trace-metal geochemical, isotope, biomarker and molecular microbiological techniques, applied to experimental and field samples, are combined to allow for an in-depth investigation of the role of copper (Cu) as a functional constituent of a key enzyme in bacterial methane oxidation. Of particular interest are the mechanisms of, and controls on, bacterial Cu acquisition through the release of methanobactin (MB), a Cu specific compound produced by methanotrophic bacteria to increase Cu availability and uptake. The existence of such a high affinity Cu uptake system implies that low Cu availability influences methanotrophic diversity and activity in natural environments. We propose to assess for the first time the distribution and temporal dynamics of methanobactin in two Swiss lakes, expecting new insights into the environmental controls on chalcophore production by methanotrophic bacteria and, in turn, methane oxidation under micro-aerobic conditions in lacustrine redox-transition zones. Anticipating the important role of reduced sulfur compounds in modulating Cu speciation in aquatic environments, our main goals will be to (1) address the role of sulfide as an important constraint on Cu-availability in freshwater, (2) to investigate the potential of MB exudation to increase the solubility and bioavailability of Cu- sulfides, and in turn (3) to assess whether MB production can enhance methane oxidation rates under Cu-limiting conditions in lakes. Within the frame of two PhD projects we propose the following research questions:    Does Cu-availability impact and possibly limit aerobic methane oxidation in lakes?    Can methanotrophic bacteria actively overcome Cu limitation through the production of  methanobactin?    Can we observe active methanobactin production in lakes and are there links between Cu, methanobactin concentrations, and methane oxidation rates?    How does Cu/sulfide interaction influence Cu speciation in a fresh water environment, and does the kinetic stability of soluble Cu-sulfide complexes at low oxygen levels decrease the bioavailability of Cu for methanotrophs?    Can Cu limitation trigger shifts of the lacustrine methanotrophic community composition?  We will address these questions in a series of laboratory experiments and field measurements in the redox-transition zones of two lakes in Switzerland (Lake Lugano and Lake Cadagno). Established methods for the detection and quantification of MB will be optimized for low- concentrate analysis in the natural environment. We will search for links between Cu availability and speciation, sulfide concentrations, methanobactin production, suboxic methane oxidation rates and microbial population structure, and we will elucidate the geochemical mechanisms of bacterial Cu acquisition from sulfides. The efficiency of Cu acquisition by methanotrophic bacteria may have profound effects on the cycling of carbon and, possibly, the global climate. Furthermore, this study may be one of the starting points for research that addresses whether biochemical strategies developed by aerobic methane oxidizers to overcome Cu limitation may have been the evolutionary response to the competition for methane between anaerobic and aerobic methane oxidation.",methanobactin; biomarker; microbial community structures; sulfide; copper in lakes; redox transition zone; methane oxidation; nutrient acquisition systems; radio-label incubations; south-alpine lakes,external_funding,Completed,3642278,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,56,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE

Comparative approaches that consider and reflect both the agency of the actors and the city as a structured setting are still rare and almost non-existent in urban anthropology. This project aims at over-coming this impasse by comparatively looking at actors and their agency in four cities. It asks: How do urbanites make their cities as social, cultural and architectural spaces? The project adopts a comparative perspective. It asks how and in what contexts urbanites encounter or distance themselves from others; how they engage in the formation of social spaces across cityscapes; and how these cities are transformed by such practices. It presumes that the formation of urbanity is a dialectical process that is equally based on the agency of the actors; their perception and conception of urban space and their imagination of the so-cial, as well as on the structured social and material environment that is simultaneously shaped by them. At an empirical level, the project compares the formation of urbanity in four cities in the Global South: Goma, DR Congo; Cartagena de Indias, Colombia; Johannesburg, South Africa; and Yaoundé, Cameroon. Each case study identifies and juxtaposes settings that are more likely to produce distanciation and social dif-ference to processes that foster encounter and inclusion. Leisure and security are transversal themes that link all four case studies. At a practical level, the choice of ?eld sites is a selection of four cities, based on the pre-sumption that the formation of urbanity and urbanisation becomes more visible in an unbi-ased comparative perspective across different cultural and social backgrounds. Our choice also reflects feasibility of empirical research and the competences of the researchers. Long-term ?eld research is conducted by two senior scholars at the University of Basel, Profs. Till Förster and Manuel Herz, two postdoc researchers, Dr. des. Barbara Heer and Dr. Silke Oldenburg (partly funded by the SNSF), and two PhD students (funded by SNSF) conjointly with partners and MA students from Basel and our partner institutions. The ?ndings will con-tribute to an understanding of urbanity and urbanisation in these cities and serve as basis for further comparisons and analyses. At a general comparative level the project aims at elaborating a balanced understanding of urbanity and urbanisation and contributes to general debates in urban studies on how to frame the urban and its speci?c sociality. Final-ly, it will lead to a deeper theorization of ur-banity and the formation of urban space in general. The project is based on the interdiscipli-nary conceptual work in the ?eld by the senior scholars and the two postdoc researchers. It is a building block of the new Urban Studies pro-gram at the University of Basel. The three new chairs of the new program will become mem-bers of the advisory board and are expected to engage in the theoretical debates about the ?ndings of this project within the framework of an interdisciplinary research group. The project will be relevant to social scientists, architects, and urban planners as it gener-ates an analytical framework that goes beyond the current pre-occupation with the de?ciency of cities in the Global South and enables re-searchers to address questions of urban change from an empirical and comparative perspec-tive.

By analysing the discourses and practices that make up HIV/AIDS policy worlds in Germany, Poland, Turkey, the UK, and at the European level, EUROPACH aims to describe the varied citizenship claims (in terms of entitlements and responsibilities) that emerge across shifting notions of Europe. Researchers will unpack the logics of policy discourses and disentangle the transnational histories that have been involved in the co-production of these policy assemblages, and develop a corresponding interactive map to be housed on the project's website. They will also record interviews with long-term activists and ersons living with HIV or AIDS, which will provide a foundation for a new European HIV/AIDS oral history archive. Ethnographic research conducted in spaces of policy development and negotiation, combined with analyses of art works engaging with the epidemic, will be used to situate citizenship models in their temporal trajectories, and then to scrutinize them - in close discussion with the project's 14 non-academic partners - for insights as to possibilities for the future.

C'est pourquoi notre approche associe etroitement ces deux poles. Tout en mobilisant au premier chef les outils de l'analyse litteraire et de la theorie critique, le projet s'inscrit egalement dans l'anthropologie culturelle et l'histoire des sciences, l'ethnologie et d'autres disciplines encore, car l'interrogation theorique des frontieres ontologiques implique des aspects geographiques (en particulier pour le corpus des recits de voyage), linguistiques (latin vs vernaculaire), formels et generiques, a un moment ou les poetiques ne sont pas encore completement stabilisees - interdisciplinarite d'autant necessaire que les savoirs « scientifiques » de l'epoque s'integrent a des regimes d'ecriture tres differents des notres.Pour mesurer la complexite des echanges entre les regnes mais aussi entre les discours, tels qu'ils se deploient de la fin du XVe au second tiers du XVIIe siecle, on explorera un corpus pluridisciplinaire, marque par l'heterogeneite et des emprunts reciproques : production medicale, juridique et theologique, litterature agronomique et cynegetique, herbiers, recits de voyage, poesie de la nature, fictions romanesques, nouvelles, traites de poetique, etc. Les ouvrages, francais ou latins, publies en France, seront au cur du projet, enrichis d'incursions dans l'ensemble des litteratures europeennes.L'enquete, menee de maniere collective, comportera trois etudes de cas.

"Bailer, Stefanie","Hug, Simon; Manow, Philip",Departement Gesellschaftswissenschaften / Politikwissenschaften (Bailer),Parliamentary Careers in Comparison,2016,"With the research project ""Parliamentary Careers in Comparison"" we propose to carry out an encompassing analysis of parliamentary candidates and parliamentarians and their activities in Switzerland and Germany as of 1949 until today. While parliamentary career research has often been rather descriptive, i.e. theoretically underspecified, confined to single countries, and/or non-dynamic, we aim to investigate biographical and behavioural data of parliamentary candidates and parliamentarians with partly novel tools (such as sequence analysis, see below) and over long periods of time in order to obtain a fuller and dynamic picture of parliamentary careers. Why is this of importance? Elections are the quintessential 'instrument of democracy' (Powell 2000). Running as a candidate, being endorsed by a party and then elected by voters, and subsequently re-running, being re-nominated and re-elected - or not - constitutes the most basic mechanism that secures political responsiveness and accountability in a representative democracy (Manin, Przeworski, &amp; Stokes 1999); see Figure 1, below. Within the party group the control of party leaders over the nomination process is also the most powerful tool to secure party discipline - and therefore one of the most important elements in the emergence of responsible government (Carey &amp; Shugart 1995; Cox 1987). Yet, despite its centrality we still lack a systematic, individual-level and dynamic understanding of the process of democratic delegation - and we therefore also lack in-depth information on how political careers impact parliamentary behaviour. This is partly explained by the scarcity of available data - in particular on episodes anterior and posterior to a spell in parliament. The project at hand aims to collect and analyse these data for two exemplary and in many respect similar cases, Switzerland and Germany, over a long period of time. We plan to analyse this data with respect to career dynamics, representative roles, parliamentary behaviour, democratic accountability and conformity with the party line. A first set of questions revolves around pre-parliamentary episodes. What are the various pre-parliamentary career paths (defined by party membership and political offices at the local/regional/national level) in Switzerland and Germany, and have they changed over time? To what extent are they dependent on the local, regional and national party? How can different pre-parliamentary career patterns be explained - are they a function of the personal preferences and characteristics of parliamentarians (e.g. gender, ambition, profession) or are they a function of the parties and the party systems, e.g. the regional structure of parties, their size, their local autonomy? With a second set of questions we investigate how political institutions influence careers. What are the effects of electoral rules (district magnitude, effective and legal thresholds, proportional vs. majoritarian rules) on careers? How do daily allowances and parliamentary pension schemes affect careers, what role does the interconnectedness of jurisdictional levels in federalist systems play? Do different degrees of 'institutionalisation' between militia and full-time parliaments lead to different career paths? Regarding post-parliamentary careers in Germany and Switzerland we will investigate whether and which individual and institutional factors drive the decision to retire, to continue the career or to seek higher public office or private employment after having served in parliament. A third strand of research questions will focus on the consequences of the different career paths on parliamentary behaviour and future post-parliamentary careers, in particular with respect to voting, committee membership, higher offices etc. We analyse whether MPs with career paths closely linked to a party follow the party line more faithfully and whether the parliamentary behaviour is reflected in the subsequent nomination process: Are loyal and active MPs rewarded and passive or dissenting MPs sanctioned with good (bad) list positions or promising and hopeless districts, respectively? What role do committee membership and chance to obtain higher offices (committee chair, chamber presidency, party group leadership, etc.) play? Moreover, we aim to compare pre-parliamentary career paths and the choice of post-parliamentary positions and see under which circumstances parliamentary service is a stepping or stumbling stone in a career. The project aims to provide a comprehensive and dynamic picture of the causes, courses and consequences of parliamentary careers in Switzerland and Germany. These two countries provide useful cases for comparison since they are both federalist countries but offer variation in important factors such as degree of parliamentary professionalization, electoral rules, orand the differing power of national parties.","parliament, career, parliamentarian",external_funding,Completed,3532378,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,64,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Importantly, such differences affect eye movements and pupil dynamics, which can be measured by eye tracking. Whereas characteristics of ocular behaviour have been related to recognition memory, it is currently unknown if the same characteristics are also linked to free recall - an important form of memory in daily life. Moreover, it remains unclear if pupil dynamics, which are influenced by emotional arousal, are related to differences in emotional memory. Specific aims: 1) to extract the eye-tracking parameters at encoding and to specify their relevance for subsequent episodic memory performance. 2) to investigate the relations of eye movement measures with different retrieval forms of memory (i.e. recall vs. recognition). 3) to investigate to what extent the found relations depend on the emotional content of the stimulus material. 4) to investigate if pupil dynamics are related to the memory enhancing effects of emotional arousal. 5) to investigate the neural correlates of those eye movements and pupil dynamics that are related to memory measures by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).Material/Methods: Data are available from a paradigm, which combines eye-tracking measures at encoding with a free recall and a recognition task consisting of emotional stimuli of variable valence and arousal potential (taken from the international affective picture system, IAPS). Measures were collected during an ongoing large-scale imaging genetics study in Basel, Switzerland, providing a unique dataset for analysis. Besides behavioural and eye-tracking measurements, it comprises functional magnetic resonance imaging data of over 1500 healthy human subjects. Before the core analysis, pre-processing as well as exploratory work on the data will be conducted. Expected value of the proposed project: This project will explore the way of which movements and pupil dynamics during memory encoding are related to episodic memory functions and will examine the underlying neural correlates.

"Ward, Thomas R.",NA,Departement Chemie / Bioanorganische Chemie (Ward),DrEAM; Directed Evolution of Artificial Metalloenzymes for In Vivo Applications,2016,"In the past decade, artificial metalloenzymes (AMs) have emerged as an attractive alternative to the more traditional enzymes and homogeneous catalysts. Such hybrid catalysts result from the incorporation of an abiotic metal cofactor within a macromolecule (protein or oligonucleotide). Artificial metalloenzymes combine attractive features of both homogeneous catalysts and enzymes, including the possibility to genetically optimize the catalytic performance of new-to-nature organometallic reactions. Can artificial metalloenzymes become as catalytically efficient as naturally-evolved metalloenzymes, even in complex biological mixtures? Herein, we outline our efforts to address this challenge by localizing and evolving AMs within the periplasm of Escherichia coli.  To achieve this objective, we will exploit AMs based on the biotin-streptavidin technology. Four subprojects have been tailored to address the challenges: i) knock-out deleterious components present in the periplasm; ii) improve the cofactor uptake through the outer-membrane; iii) engineer streptavidin to boost the AM's performance; and iv) rely both on screening and selection strategies to evolve AMs in vivo. Relying on auxotrophs, we will demonstrate the potential of AMs to complement metabolic pathways. Only E. coli auxotrophs containing an evolved AM capable of producing the vital aminoacid-precursor will survive the stringent selection pressure. We have identified several selectable aminoacid precursors which can be produced by metathesis (indole, precursor of tryptophan), enone reduction (keto valine, precursor of valine) and allylic substitution (prephenate, precursor of tyrosine and phenylalanine). In a Darwinian evolution spirit, we anticipate that applying selection pressure will allow to evolve AMs to unprecedented catalytic performance.

Sperry postulated that selective neuronal connectivity is achieved by chemoaffinity labels. Several such labels for axon guidance and topographic mapping have been defined. However, until recently, molecules that direct the recognition of synaptic partners and functional specification of synapses have remained obscure. Chemoaffinity tags are envisioned to provide a recognition code that would encompass the recognition of self versus non-self, recognition of sister cells, and recognition of appropriate and inappropriate synaptic partners.  Key parameters that determine the function of recognition systems are the diversity (number of independently recognizable tags), the repertoires of recognition tags in a cell population, and the contribution of tags to selective interactions. The finite number of protein-coding genes in the human genome severely limits the genetic resources that can be employed for generating molecular diversity. In this project we will test the hypothesis that alternative splicing is a central mechanism for the amplification of molecular diversity in recognition tags and their role in synaptic specificity. We will implement novel mass-spectrometry and sequencing methods to define molecular diversity of a highly diversified receptor family in mice. We will unravel the logic of receptor repertoires across cell populations and test the importance of cell type-specific alternative splicing programs for synaptic specificity.

In order to approach this aim, I pursue three lines of research and bundle them in three manuscripts. In the first manuscript, I rely on McAdams and Pals' (2006) conception of a three-layered personality. I shed light on the concurrent associations between the three major components consisting of personality traits, characteristic adaptations, and life narratives. Further, I investigate their impact on both partners' life and relationship satisfaction with a particular focus on the yet understudied influence of the narrative layer. In the second manuscript, I consider the reciprocal interplay between personality and romantic relationships and investigate how romantic partners mutually shape their personality development. A prominent approach that is dedicated to assess personal growth in romantic relationships and that will be the cornerstone of this manuscript is the Michelangelo phenomenon (Rusbult, Finkel, &amp; Kumashiro, 2009). Therein, I apply a life-span perspective by comparing the key components of the phenomenon between three generations. Moreover, I will account for the conceptual interdependence of romantic relationships and implement the phenomenon into the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model (Kenny, Kashy, &amp; Cook, 2006), which is the prominent statistical model for analyzing dyadic relationships. In the third manuscript, I focus on relationship outcomes and review the most-cited relationship outcomes within the last 20 years of relationship research. The anchor of this sorting process is Deci and Ryan's (2000) self-determination theory with the three basic needs of relatedness, autonomy and competence. Additionally to assorting, the aim is to provide a nuanced discussion that will lead into a more comprehensive understanding of relationship outcomes. In sum, my dissertation is envisaged to last over a period of three years. The present manuscripts will illuminate the complex and dynamic interplay between personality and romantic relationships by analyzing how components of personality are interrelated and differentially contribute to both partners' relationship satisfaction (manuscript 1), by examining personality development through the lenses of life-span and dyadic research (manuscript 2), and by sorting relationship outcomes with regard to humans' most elementary needs (manuscript 3).",Personality Development; Personality; Romantic Relationships; Self-Determination Theory ; Michelangelo Phenomenon,external_funding,Completed,1201828,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,71,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

The research develops along three main lines of inquiry, which we define in terms of Work Packages (WPs). For all WPs, we rely on German administrative data from plants in the manufacturing sector. Broadly speaking, the first WP takes an aggregate look at economic outcomes at the firm level. The second WP aims to identify the mechanisms underlying these economic outcomes in terms of changes in efficiency. The last WP uses the firms in the sample as a case study to assess the efficiency of emissions trading as a policy instrument more generally.   The first WP consists of a thorough analysis of the impacts of the EU ETS on regulated firms in the German manufacturing industry. Building on recent contributions, we apply a matching framework to investigate the causal impact of the EU ETS on treated firms in terms of a number of environmental, technical and economic indicators. The contribution of this WP is twofold. Relative to the existing literature, we work on a finer level of sectoral disaggregation. Second, we compute an index of environmental policy stringency at the sectoral level for both ETS and non-ETS firms by estimating the shadow price of emissions. This analysis will provide us with new insights into the impact imposed by the EU ETS across different manufacturing subsectors in Germany, as well as into the efficiency of the EU ETS.   In WP 2, we use a productivity analysis framework (using both data envelopment analysis and stochastic frontier analysis) to examine the impact of the ETS in terms of firm-level efficiency. We aim to analyze different aspects of efficiency related to production, costs, revenue and profits. Comparing ETS firms with matched control firms will offer a deeper understanding about the nature of the effect of the EU ETS on the regulated firms than is possible by focusing on economic outcomes alone. For example, a failure to find significant differences in terms of output or revenue between treated and non-treated firms may be caused by an increase in costs that is accompanied by an improvement in productive efficiency in response to the regulation.   In the third WP, we will use an econometric approach to estimate firms' abatement cost functions. The principal cost advantage of an ETS relative to command-and-control regulation is that emissions abatement takes place where it is cheapest, rather than uniformly across firms and sectors. To date, there has been no analysis of the extent to which these gains from trade have materialized in the EU ETS (or in any other permit market, for that matter). Estimating abatement cost functions on the firm-level will enable us to compute the least-cost outcome within manufacturing firms, and compare this to the abatement costs associated with a hypothetical command-and-control regulation as well as the actual costs of abatement within German manufacturing firms.",EU ETS; Emissions trading; Program evaluation; Climate change; Emission permit markets,external_funding,Completed,3242117,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,72,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"Mrsic-Flogel, Thomas",NA,Departement Biozentrum / Neural Networks (Mrsic-Flogel),The organisation and function of long-range projections in visual cortex,2016,"  Our senses are constantly bombarded with a vast amount of information. To perceive this information and to guide behaviour, the brain must extract and amplify a relatively small number of features from this massive input, corresponding for example to the nature and location of objects in the world. In mammals, the cerebral cortex plays a central role in this process. The cortex contains multiple hierarchically-arranged areas devoted to each modality. Each cortical area contains a richly interconnected array of diverse cell types, whose patterns of connectivity underlie the cortex's ability to extract sensory features or generate more complex representations of the external world. While connections between nearby neurons mediate local information processing within each cortical region, extensive long-range projections mediate the exchange of information between cortical areas specialised in different functions. Surprisingly little is known about the rules of connectivity and resulting computations in long-range circuits that link cortical areas. This knowledge may be crucial for developing a conceptual framework of what the cortex actually computes and how it computes it within hierarchically organised cortical networks. The proposed research aims to understand the fundamental anatomical organizational principles of long-range neuronal circuits in the visual cortex, comprised of multiple distinct types of projection neurons, and how this organization relates to their molecular identity and the information they represent during visual processing. We focus on the visual cortex of the mouse using a combination of methods, including anatomical labelling and reconstructions of long-range projection neurons, two-photon calcium imaging of neuronal activity in awake or behaving mice, assessment of connectivity by in vitro whole-cell recordings and optogenetics, single-cell transcriptomics of anatomically and functionally characterised neurons, in vivo optogenetics, and visual behavioural tasks. The research plan outlined in this proposal with address the following main aims: (i) What is the fine-scale anatomical organisation of long-range circuits in primary visual cortex? We will focus on uncovering the diversity and connectional logic of excitatory projection neurons that transmit information from visual cortex to downstream cortical areas. (ii) What visual information is represented by diverse projection neurons in primary visual cortex during visual processing? We will determine how the visual response properties of different types of projection neurons relate to the cortical areas they target, and how their activity is modulated by intra-cortical feedback while mice engage in different behavioural tasks requiring vision. (iii) What are the molecular determinants of long-range connectivity and function of projection neurons in primary visual cortex? We will test the hypothesis that there is relationship between the molecular identify of projection neurons on one hand, as determined by their transcriptional profile, and the target areas they innervate as well as their visual response properties on the other. Together, this work will provide an insight into the fine-scale organisation and function of long-range cortical circuits, which is crucial for understanding information processing across different cortical areas. This knowledge may be used to uncover what goes wrong in neurological disorders in which inter-areal communication is compromised, such as Schizophrenia and autism. Each cortical area contains a richly interconnected array of diverse cell types, whose patterns of connectivity underlie the cortex's ability to extract sensory features or generate more complex representations of the external world. Extensive long-range projections mediate the exchange of information between cortical areas specialised in different functions.

Perception is thought to originate in neuronal interactions within the cerebral cortex, where the information from our sense organs is processed by complex pathways involving multiple cortical areas.  However, all cortical areas also form extensive and complex loops with the thalamus from which the cortex receives the large majority of its input. Surprisingly, the function of these cortico-thalamo-cortical interactions remains unclear. This proposal focuses on the visual system of the mouse as a model for understanding the mechanisms and function of these ubiquitous interactions between cortex and thalamus during sensory processing. In the visual system, information from the eye is relayed via the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus (dLGN) to the primary visual cortex (V1), from where it is transmitted into a hierarchy of increasingly higher-order cortical areas. However, the pulvinar, the largest thalamic nucleus in primates and humans, seems to break this hierarchy. This nucleus is heavily interconnected with most visual cortical areas and can strongly influence their activity. It therefore forms a major circuit hub and likely plays an important role in visual processing. However, the function of the pulvinar remains unclear, and its interactions with the cortex are poorly understood. Using a combination of state-of-the-art methods, including in vivo two-photon imaging and single-unit electrophysiology in behaving mice, in vivo optogenetics, viral tracing techniques, connectivity mapping by in vitro whole-cell recordings and optogenetics, and visual behavioural tasks, we will determine the functional role of pulvinar thalamocortical interactions during cortical processing of visual information in the behaving mouse. Specifically, we will address the following main aims: 1) What is the fine-scale organization of visual cortico-thalamo-cortical pathways? We will determine the specificity of pulvinar projections, with respect to the cortical areas they target and the inputs they receive. 2) How do neuronal responses in the pulvinar depend on inputs it receives from distinct brain areas? We will test how silencing of specific brain regions and cell types affect neuronal activity in the pulvinar in response to visual stimuli and during different visually-guided behaviours. 3) What influence does the pulvinar have on different cortical areas and by which circuit mechanisms? We will determine the postsynaptic targets of pulvinar projections in the cortex, the impact of activating these projections on neuronal activity in different cortical areas, as well as the circuit mechanisms of the observed effects. 4) What function does the pulvinar serve during visual processing in different behavioural contexts? We will measure what information the pulvinar conveys to different cortical areas and test how silencing pulvinar input affects visual processing in different visual areas, the interactions between cortical areas, and the animals' behavioural performance.  Together, the proposed work will significantly contribute to our understanding on how visual input is processed by the actively engaged brain and fill a substantial gap in our knowledge about the contribution of the thalamus to this process.",NA,external_funding,Completed,3623862,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,74,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

These two types of extremely oxygenated mud normally experience strong compaction and display low color-contrast because of rather uniform composition. Both factors lower recognizability of sedimentary structures in outcrops considerably - probably a reason for the small number of detailed ichnological studies. However, polishing of mudrock in the field has already been proven to enhance visibility of sedimentary structures and will applied during the proposed project. Furthermore, uncompacted structures are preserved in concretions that will be studied. The outcrops proposed to be investigated are located in the Carpathians (Poland) and in the Neuquén Basin (Argentina). They have already been visited cursorily and they are definitely suitable for the proposed investigations. Burrowing organisms sensitively respond to oxygenation on and within the seafloor. The assemblage of trace fossils, their size, their penetration depth, and spatial arrangement document that bioturbation itself was a major factor in enhancing oxygen flux deeper into sediment. Besides oxygenation sedimentation rate and deposition of organic matter considerably influence the sedimentary record of extreme oxygenation stages. Bioturbational structures are reliable indicators of the depositional environment. For both extreme oxygenation settings general ichnological models exist, whereas detailed studies are only few.

As a matter of fact, mathematical modeling and numerical simulations allow for the creation of - prototypical or patient-specific - models, which can be used to study, e.g., the function of organs such as the human heart, or to evaluate and plan for individualized therapies. Using established forward models, different studies have been carried out, providing sensitivity analysis on the basis of forward simulations and a more or less straightforward sampling of the parameter spaces. However, the newly developed ideas and mathematical insights from Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) do allow for a much more precise and efficient quantification of important sensitivities in cardiac simulations. It is therefore the goal of this proposal to exploit ideas and techniques from UQ for simulations in cardiology, in particular electrophysiology, and to develop simulation tools, which in the very end will provide reliable estimates of parameter sensitivities to the clinician for patient-specific simulations in electrophysiology. More precisely, we plan to consider the equations modeling the bioelectrical activity of the cardiac tissue, which are parametrized by conductivity tensor fields that, in practice, are not known exactly. This motivates to model them as random fields which, in turn, yields a solution that is a random field.

This bottom-up approach yields new soft, hybrid materials that benefit from the robustness of polymers and the functionality of biomolecules. We propose to synthesize new amphiphilic diblock and triblock copolymers with combined stimuli-responsive behaviour, and different functional end-groups that allow specific interactions with biomolecules.

Such biomolecule-polymer supramolecular assemblies can support complex reactions in protected spaces at the nanoscale, and allow specific targeting approaches. Multifunctional membranes could function as tools for membrane protein characterization, and as new devices for biosensing.

"Zavolan, Mihaela",NA,Departement Biozentrum / Bioinformatics (Zavolan),Regulation of mRNA translation and its relationship with disease,2016,"Protein synthesis is at the core of cellular life. Consequently, a vast proportion of a cell's resources is dedicated to this process, which is reflected in the ribosomes taking up a large fraction of a cell's mass. Proliferative states are associated with a further increase in the fraction of the cellular mass dedicated to the translation machinery. The translation process is targeted by many antibacterial agents which exploit the fact that bacterial ribosomes differ from those of eukaryotes. Moreover, a global reduction in translation by means of inhibiting the RNA polymerase I is being explored as a therapeutic possibility in cancers. In recent years, novel mechanisms for modulating the rate, efficiency or site of translation, either globally or for specific transcripts, in relation to the cellular state have been uncovered. Among these are condition-specific alterations in transfer RNA abundance, expression of particular ribosomal proteins in specific disease states, the change in the RNA-binding protein interactome of transcripts through alternative polyadenylation, and RNA modifications such as the 1 or 6-methyladenosine. Nevertheless, the relative importance of translation and transcription regulation for gene expression is highly debated and the breadth and mechanisms underlying dynamic changes in translation are not well understood. Evidence has started to emerge that dynamic sub-cellular structures that are organized in part by multi-valent RNAs and in part by proteins with intrinsically disordered domains play a role. The aim of the project proposed here is to characterize the role of specific mechanisms that we have uncovered in our previous work, in modulating mRNA translation in relation to normal and disease states. Thus, we would like to investigate the impact on mRNA translation of systematic changes in 3'UTR lengths as a result of changes in cell state (e.g. cell differentiation) or in the expression of regulators of 3'UTR length. Having already identified systems in which the aforementioned behaviors can be studied, we would now like to undertake their molecular characterization and evaluate their relevance for cell differentiation, development and cancer. Succinctly, the work outlined in this proposal aims to elucidate cell type-specific translational programs that are rooted in specific regulators and could open new avenues for engineering cellular behaviors.

The existence of these Bell correlations has profound implications for the foundations of physics and at the same time underpins a variety of quantum information technologies that are currently being developed. While Bell correlations have been observed in systems of at most a few (usually two) particles, their role in many-body systems is largely unexplored. There are many open questions on how to create, detect and quantify Bell correlations in many-body systems, on their use in quantum technology, and on the connection between Bell correlations and many-particle entanglement. In this project, we will use atomic Bose-Einstein condensates on an atom chip - an exceptionally well-controlled quantum many-body system - for experiments on Bell correlations and many-particle entanglement and their application in quantum technology. In a recent breakthrough, the applicant's group reported the first observation of Bell correlations in a many-body system. Based on this result, we will study in depth the character of these correlations between atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate. We will develop and test improved Bell correlation witnesses, including those that detect genuine many-particle Bell correlations, and aim at closing the statistics loophole. We will explore the possibility of performing a device-independent Bell test with hundreds of atoms. Moreover, we will investigate the use of Bell correlations in many-body systems for quantum information tasks. In previous experiments, entanglement and Bell correlations were detected between atoms in the same cloud, by performing global manipulations and measurements on the entire atomic ensemble. In this project we will go further and perform experiments with two spatially separated, individually addressable Bose-Einstein condensates. Based on a recent proposal, we will explore the generation of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) entanglement between the two condensates through collisions in a state-dependent potential. Such EPR entanglement is relevant for quantum metrology, because it allows to predict the outcome of spin measurements in one cloud conditioned on a corresponding measurement in the other cloud with higher precision than what is allowed by a naive application of the Heisenberg uncertainty relation. In the next step, we will explore Bell correlations between the two separate Bose-Einstein condensates, where the nonlocal character of these correlations can be directly revealed. We will explore the possibility of directly violating a Bell inequality with the two condensates in a device-independent way.

Physiologically, Ca2+ signals result both from the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (endo/sarcoplasmic reticulum) as well as influx from the extracellular environment, via the opening of channels on the plasma membrane. In skeletal muscle, Ca2+ regulates contraction and relaxation and alterations in its regulation can lead to several neuromuscular disorders among which Malignant Hyperthermia, Core myopathies, Centronuclear myopathy, Native American Myopathy, Tubular aggregate myopathy and Brody's disease. Type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) is a key protein involved in the regulation of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration in skeletal muscle cells, playing a crucial role in muscle contraction by releasing Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum after plasma membrane depolarization. RyR1 is most abundantly expressed in skeletal muscles and to lower extents in some areas of the central nervous system, in antigen presenting cells (B-lymphocytes and dendritic cells) and in smooth muscle cells. Thus mutations in RYR1 (the gene encoding RyR1) may lead to alterations of Ca2+ homeostasis not only in skeletal muscle, but also in other tissues expressing this intracellular calcium release channel. Indeed RYR1 mutations have been implicated in other clinical conditions such as bleeding abnormalities, exertional rhabdomyolysis, sepsis and intensive care polyneuropathy, broadening theclinical spectrum of disorders linked to altered RyR1 function. The disease phenotype resulting from RYR1 mutations largely depends on their location within the RYR1 coding sequence and whether the mutations are dominant or recessive. Dominant mutations are more commonly associated with the Malignant Hyperthermia Susceptibility/exertional rhabdomyolysis and Central Core Disease phenotypes, while most cases of Multiminicore Disease, Centronuclear myopathy and Congenital Fiber Type Dysproportion phenotypes are associated with recessive mutations. From a general point of view, dominant RYR1 mutations affect thebiophysical properties of the Ca2+ channel while the mode of action of recessive mutations has been more difficult to decipher but a consistent finding is a significant decrease of the RyR1 protein present in skeletal muscle. In order to gain mechanistic insight into the causes of this drastic decrease in RyR1 content, we have investigated if epigenetic modifications occur in the muscles of affected patients. Our results confirm that profound changes in the epigenetic landscape occur in the muscles of patients with recessive RYR1 mutations, including RYR1 CpG island hyper-methylation, decrease in muscle-specific microRNA content and abnormal expression of class II histone deacetylases.The aim of this project is to gain insight into the mechanisms causing the epigenetic modifications and validate whether they represent valid pharmacological targets. In order to do this we will use cellular and a knock in animal model that we have generated. The knock in mouse model will also help identify biomarkers that could be used to monitor disease progression or regression. Of importance, similar epigenetic modifications may occur in the muscles of patients affected by other congenital myopathies (nemaline, myotubular and SEPN1-related myopathies). One of the major aims of research in congenital myopathies is to find a common pharmacological target. Thus discovering a common pharmacological target downstream the primary genetic defect could potentially benefit a large number of patients.","ryanodine receptor, calcium, down regulation, Congenital muscle disorders, epigenetic modification, mouse model, pathophysiology",external_funding,Completed,3623903,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,81,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

While obesity and type 2-diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of the diastolic dysfunction frequently observed in these patients, the underlying mechanisms are only poorly understood and therapy of HFpEF therefore remains highly empirical. Moreover, the mechanistic insights obtained to date are mainly based on studies with male mice and virtually nothing is known in about the pathophysiology in female. Because the disease is particularly frequent in the female population after menopause, the overall aim of our research is to identify novel gender-specific mechanisms that protect against diastolic dysfunction.   It is well-known that 17&#946;-estradiol (E2) has direct beneficial effects in the ischemic or pressure-overloaded heart via the estrogen receptor (ER)&#945; and ER&#946;. Recently, it was discovered that the orphan G protein-coupled receptor 30 specifically mediates non-genomic effects of E2 and it therefore was renamed to ""G protein-coupled estrogen receptor"" (GPER). The GPER has been implicated in regulating metabolism and inflammation, two important features of metabolic disease, but its role in obesity-related cardiac dysfunction has not been investigated. The proposed project therefore has the following aims: Aim 1: To analyze the effects of gender and ovarian hormones on cardiac hemodynamics in obese mice. Aim 2: To analyze gender-specific mechanisms of cardiac dysfunction in high fat/high sucrose (HFD)-induced obesity.  Aim 3: To analyze the role of the GPER in regulating cardiac inflammation, metabolism and function after HFD feeding. For aim 1, we will use echocardiography, pressure volume loop analysis and the ex vivo working heart setup to analyze cardiac metabolism and hemodynamic function in male, female, and OVX-female mice on a HFD. For aim 2, we will test whether  OVX-HFD increases inflammatory responses and thereby increases fibrosis and decreases diastolic function. mTOR, either directly or indirectly via its effects on PKC, alters titin's phosphorylation and isoform expression. gender-related differences in calcium handling along with reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ATPase (SERCA2a) expression contribute to cardiac dysfunction. gender-related differences in glucose uptake and/or autophagy lead to a changed energy status, which in turn explains a decline in contractile and relaxation performance of the heart of OVX-obese mice, in particular under energy-demanding conditions such as dobutamine- or pacing-induced stress.  For aim 3, the GPER agonist G-1 will be applied in ex vivo working heart as well as in vivo experiments. With the proposed experiments we hope to test the hypotheses that (1) enhanced cardiac inflammatory responses in ovariectomized obese female mice lead to decreased cardiac compliance by increasing fibrosis, (2) impaired glucose metabolism and autophagy in obesity cause reduced cardiac relaxation during diastole, effects that are worsened after ovariectomy, (3) G-1 can be used therapeutically to prevent inflammation-induced fibrosis and to ameliorate glucose metabolism.

This will be applied to spectroscopic probes,primarily nitriles (-CN), which are sensitive environmental probes forprotein interiors. Fluctuating MTPs will be used to study the 1d- and2d-IR spectroscopy of-CN-containing inhibitors in human aldosereductase (hALR2) and benzonitrile in Lysozyme. Multiplesurface-ARMD will be combined with the fewest switching surfacehopping (FSSH) methodology for investigating nonadiabatic effects inchemical dynamics. This will considerably extend the range ofapplicability for MS-ARMD. Initial applications concernphotodissociation and recombination of ICN in solution and O2formation in amorphous ice at low temperatures. In a next step, thestructural and solvent dynamics upon oxidation from Cu(I) to Cu(II) incopper-phenanthroline complexes will be investigated. Also, standardARMD simulations will be used to study multiple-ligand dynamics in theactive site of truncated Hemoglobin N which is responsible fordenitrification. Molecular mechanics with proton transfer will becombined with multi state-ARMD to investigate proton transfer in thecondensed phase on extended time scales.

The starting point of the analysis is based on the observation that Switzerland served as an important place for Middle Eastern political activists of all kinds of ideological aspirations during the first half of the 20th century. By conducting research on the still unexplored topic of Swiss-based Middle Eastern Muslims-mostly students and refugees, who were either exiled from their home countries by the mandate authorities or fled as political refugees to escape persecutions at the hands of their own governments-the project will enable bridging the two disciplines, namely the history of Switzerland and Islamic/Middle Eastern studies. At the same time, the study sheds light on the field of transnational history by analyzing the relationship between the local, such as the Swiss society and Switzerland's administrative bodies, and the global, such as transnational ideas in the form of pan-religious aspirations and national movements performed in exile.  The more or less welcoming attitude of Swiss authorities toward the new arrivals was often accompanied by suspicion of the so-called ""Islamist activities and machinations"" (Islamistische Umtriebe). The same-titled dossiers on such activities can be found in the Swiss Federal Archive in Bern. Moreover, the Swiss Federal Department of Justice &amp; Police (FDJP) have opened personal files on those Middle Easterners who were under surveillance due to their political activism such as the case of the well-known Lebanese activist Shakib Arslan. These dossiers as well as relevant materials from the cantonal and university archives, such as lists of foreign students, will serve as a starting point for a comprehensive analysis of the lebenswelt (lifeworld) of Middle Eastern Muslims on Swiss territory. The sum of all sources-exchange of letters between different authorities, protocols, personal writings and letters, footage, and press media-serves as ego-documents in a wider sense.  This project seeks to trace the presence of Middle Eastern Muslims, in order to explore the perception of the Swiss authorities regarding their activities, to frame their lifeworld and ideological points of view, and also to gauge their interconnectedness-both with their compatriots and with the Swiss civil society. Therefore, the study will provide answers to questions such as how ideas and ideologies were circulating, who was in contact with whom, and how the relationships between the different actors influenced their actions and points of view.  This project will approach the topic by presupposing on the one hand the perspective of histoire croisée and on the other hand by implementing the method of lebenswelt. This method helps to emphasize both the micro and the macro historical level, since research on the lifeworld of an individual includes the analysis of social, political, and cultural structures.","Islam in Europe, Switzerland, interwar period, Muslim networks in Europe, Muslim intellectuals in Europe, Swiss policy regarding foreigners, Swiss policy regarding Middle Easterners, lifeworld, exile, students in Switzerland, Arabs in Switzerland, Persia",external_funding,Completed,3623916,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,84,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

The project proposes that analyzing the idea of authenticity from the perspective of comparison can contribute to our understanding of authenticity claims in Chinese philosophy specifically, but also of the concept of authenticity in general. The research project pursues a relational theory of authenticity. Concepts of authenticity that are committed to the metaphysical or epistemic doctrine of essentialism, for instance, to a distinction of an inner Chinese essence and its outer philosophical expression, will be rejected. The general critique of essentialism will be supported by analyzing concrete cases.

Work over the past years has revealed an unexpected role for members of the coronin protein family, that are widely expressed in all eukaryotic species, in the transfer of extracellular triggers to an intracellular response.

The goal of the present project is to delineate the mechanism of coronin-mediated modulation of signal transduction at the molecular level. The results from this project may contribute to a better understanding of cellular homeostasis and activation.

Essential drugs like the cancer medication taxol/paclitaxel or the malaria drug artemisinin belong to the terpene family. They are efficiently formed in nature through a so-called tail-to-head terpene cyclization. Chemists are not able to mimic this process with man-made catalysts. This proposal aims at closing this significant research gap by utilizing supramolecular chemistry. Learning how to design such complex catalysts will not only enable us to mimic natural enzymes, but to enter uncharted territory of terpene chemistry.The main objective is the development of selective catalysts for terpene cyclizations. This certainly poses the greatest challenge within this proposal. Therefore, two independent work packages were devised to tackle this challenge. A novel class of self-assembled catalysts will be developed which are able to control the conformation of the substrate, thereby allowing for selectivity in the cyclization process. The active site of these catalysts can be modified to selectively produce the desired terpene product. Additionally, dynamic covalent chemistry will be employed to construct covalent catalyst structures.As the second objective, this proposal aims to greatly expand the natural variety of terpenes by utilizing unnatural terpene cyclization precursors. Utilizing the catalysts developed from objective 1, unprecedented artemisinin drug derivatives, which are not accessible via other routes, will be synthesized.This project will provide catalysts which are able to predictably constrain the conformation of the substrate.

In human biology, CPMEs are involved in committed steps of metabolism, e.g. in lipid or sterol biosynthesis, with close links to cancerogenesis.  A key characteristic of the 10-­20nm sized multienzymes is their highly dynamic protein architecture.

This view, lingualism, falls foul of David Hume's animal test, according to which the plausibility of a theory about the mind is, in part, determined by its implications regarding nonhuman animals. Lingualism about thought does not pass Hume's animal test because it implies that animals which do not make use of language are ipso facto unable to think. A theory that meets the demands of the animal test is Jerry Fodor's Language of Thought hypothesis (LOTH), according to which thought is not constitutively connected to any natural language such as English or Italian, it rather bears the form of mental representations, which are structured according to the principles of a mental language, which is innate. However, the LOTH also faces a problem regarding animal thoughts, namely the problem of indeterminacy in translating animal thoughts. Since, according to the LOTH, animal thoughts bear a language-like sentential format, namely the format of the Language of Thought, they should in principle be translatable into sentences of some natural language. But, as both empirical and theoretical research suggest, there are strong reasons to believe that insurmountable indeterminacies as regards the interpretation of animal thought into sentential formats would strongly distort the contents of the thoughts. This problem of indeterminacy can be tackled if we distinguish different formats of thought: sentential formats and non-sentential formats, such as cartographic thought. Motivated by the problems animal minds pose for classical accounts of the mind, this PhD project will elaborate how non-sentential formats of thought help to explain both similarities and differences in cognitive abilities between humans and nonhuman animals.

This occurs through aqueous channels that perforate the double-membrane nuclear envelope (NE) known as nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). Importantly, each NPC regulates the selective translocation of signal-specific cargoes whilst rejecting non-specific macromolecules. Tethered within each ~50 nm-diameter NPC lie numerous intrinsically disordered proteins known as phenylalanine-glycine (FG) nucleoporins (i.e., or FG Nups) that enforce this selective barrier functionality. Cargo-carrying transport receptors (known as karyopherins or Kaps, importins or exportins) exclusively traverse the NPC via multivalent interactions with the FG Nups. After more than two decades of research, the NPC selective barrier mechanism is still unresolved. As a case in point, how the FG Nups promote selective Kap-cargo traffic while simultaneously blocking smaller non-specific macromolecules remains speculative based on the following reasons: First, the FG Nups still elude direct visualization inside native NPCs. Thus, barrier models that derive from in vitro experimentation remain invalidated. Second, nucleocytoplasmic transport in vivo proceeds through NPCs in a matter of milliseconds. Hence, to be precise, it is the dynamic spatiotemporal behavior of the FG Nups rather than their static properties (i.e., time-independent) that governs NPC function. Third, it remains puzzling how multivalent Kap-FG Nup binding interactions (i.e., avidity) expedite fast transport. Fourth, it is unknown if NPCs can structurally deform to aid the translocation of large cargoes. Here, we will interrogate and dissect dynamic FG Nup behavior directly inside native NPCs from X. laevis oocytes and S. cerevisiae (including &#8710;FG mutant strains) at transport-relevant timescales (~100 ms) and under various trafficking conditions (e.g., RanGTP). Our work centers on high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM), which resolves FG Nup behavior approaching the spatiotemporal resolution of coarse-grained computer simulations (Sakiyama et al, Nature Nanotechnology, in press). We will correlate this data to authentic transport events by integrating the HS-AFM onto a fluorescence microscope. This will be complemented by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements of Kap-FG Nup binding and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) of isolated nuclei.

All are progressive and display brain region-specific vulnerability to disease, despite widespread expression of the disease-associated protein particular to each disorder. Furthermore, pathological lesions propagate through the brain in a pattern resembling functional connectivity of the healthy brain and they all display abnormal protein folding and aggregation. Diseases belonging to the group of PMD's include Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal lobar dementia (FTLD) and Huntington's disease (HD). Accumulating evidence suggests that transneuronal propagation of protein pathology occurs in all these disorders. This phenomenon was long thought to be unique for the spreading of prion protein in prion disorders. For some of the mutant disease proteins convincing experimental evidence now exists that they can spread from the site of inoculation or expression, to other but functionally connected brain regions. However, many aspects of this process remain unknown including its contribution to disease progression and the underlying molecular mechanisms. This also hampers the discovery of potential novel therapeutics in PMDs. Therefore, the aim of my research is to address these questions by using HD as a model disease. HD is an excellent model since it is monogenic and fully-penetrant. Importantly, we have recently shown that the disease-causing mutant huntingtin protein undergoes transneuronal propagation in the mouse brain in vivo. Although different transneuronal protein propagation mechanisms have been proposed for each of the disease proteins in PMDs, it is likely that these mechanisms also share common principles and molecular mechanisms. Therefore, my work aims not only at improving our understanding of mHTT transneuronal propagation and its relevance to the HD process, but also bears and likely is of translational relevance to other PMDs.

Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may contribute to the development and progression of major diseases, including developmental disorders, immune diseases, various forms of cancer and cardio-metabolic diseases such as diabetes, but the mechanisms underlying chemical-induced disruption of endocrine functions are often unknown. Thus, there is a great demand to identify key events of disrupted steroid homeostasis, as well as to develop suitable tools - in vitro and in silico - for early detection of chemical-induced disturbances of steroid homeostasis.  Objectives The aim is to generate experimental data that can serve as a basis to improve regulatory test systems for the characterisation of EDCs affecting steroidogenesis and peripheral steroid action. Current regulatory tests for EDCs focus on effects on oestrogen, androgen, and thyroid receptor signalling and on sex steroid production, but do not adequately assess mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids and adrenal androgens. The proposed project aims to refine the use of the established regulatory cell-based test system (the human adrenal cancer cell line H295R) to characterise effects on these other steroids.

"Broz, Petr",NA,Departement Biozentrum / Infection Biology (Broz),Characterization of the mechanisms of inflammasome assembly and signaling,2017,"Inflammation is a rapid, highly coordinated response of the immune system to infection, cellular injury or irritants1. The inflammatory response needs to be tightly regulated and quickly terminated to prevent unnecessary damage to tissues and to the organism. Chronic inflammation is the underlying cause of many autoimmune disorders as well as atherosclerosis, ischaemic heart disease and even some types of cancer. A major trigger of inflammation is the recognition of microbial pathogens and tissue damage by cells and receptors of the innate immune system2,3. A subset of these receptors controls the formation of ""inflammasomes"", cytosolic multi-protein signaling complexes that serve as an activation platform for the mammalian cysteine protease caspase-14. Active caspase-1 promotes the induction of a lytic inflammatory cell death named pyroptosis and controls the maturation and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1-beta (IL-1&#946;) and IL-18. Activation of caspase-1 requires tight control, since the dysregulation of inflammasome signaling is linked to many hereditary and acquired inflammatory disorders, commonly referred to as inflammasomopathies. Despite its central role in immunity and auto-inflammatory diseases, numerous aspects of inflammasomes remain uncharacterized, such as the structure of the different inflammasome complexes, their regulation and the mechanism by which they induce pyroptosis and cytokine release. In addition, although caspase-1 is crucial for a successful innate immune defense, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate caspase-1 activity in vivo. Intriguingly, the same receptors that recognize pathogens also respond to danger signals resulting from cell injuries and can cause severe autoinflammatory disorders when dysregulated.

How Act, Actor, and Victim (Facial) Characteristics Impact Moral Judgments",2017,"First encounters are known to strongly influence how individuals perceive others; the power of ""first impressions"" is even part of collective wisdom represented in proverbs (e.g., ""You never get a second chance to make a first impression"") and fiction. One particular prominent source affecting first impressions is the human face. Individuals use facial information to instantly and spontaneously build first impressions about the personality of others (e.g., Bruce &amp; Young, 1986; Ito &amp; Urland, 2003; Willis &amp; Todorov, 2006). These persistent personality inferences can be mapped in a 2D space defined by the two fundamental dimensions trustworthiness and dominance (Oosterhof &amp; Todorov, 2008). Trustworthiness and dominance are unique dimensions in that they are informative about whether a person has good or bad intentions (i.e., trustworthiness) and whether he or she is able to act on these intentions (i.e., dominance). Interestingly, a person perception perspective suggests that individuals have a strong desire to infer other's moral character from whatever cue might be informative, whereas in moral psychological research, moral character plays a negligible role. Building on normative philosophical theories of morality, Moral Psychology focuses on acts rather than actors in assessing the morality of an action (Pizarro &amp; Tannenbaum, 2011; Tannenbaum, Uhlmann, &amp; Diermeier, 2011; Uhlmann, Pizarro, &amp; Diermeier, 2015). Accordingly, it suggests that the morality of a moral action is evaluated based on the assessment of the actors' intentions and goals in this given situation as well as the outcome of the action. Thereby, Moral Psychology disregards the fundamental social psychological finding that perceivers tend to overestimate stable actor characteristics and underestimate characteristics of a given situation in explaining actions (Heider, 1958; Ross, 1977) and the strong motivation of individuals to keep track on the moral character of others, for example by inferring it from their appearance (Oosterhof &amp; Todorov, 2008). This project aims to bridge this gap by investigating the impact of moral character (derived from facial appearance) on the evaluation of moral actions comprehensively.","moral judgments, face modeling, faces",external_funding,Completed,3606624,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,100,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

An important feature of such transitions is that the market structure is likely to change during the transition. New entrants, which use new technologies, could replace incumbents, as is the case in some energy transitions. In contrast, incumbents could invest themselves in new technologies and thereby keep newcomers out of the market, as has been the in the CFC-phase out. Current environmental economic theory is not well equipped to describe such transitions, as it either takes the market structure or the technology as given and fixed. This project aims to develop a novel approach for investigating technology transitions. In several steps, it will develop and analyze a theoretical economic model that describes how policy-induced firm investments shape a market structure, which in turn alters investment incentives, and how this feedback-loop evolves over time. The model will be used to analyze governmental policy, for example the questions: Should a government support new entrants or keep old firms in the market via subsidies? What should be the duration of such interventions?

Background The thymic microenvironment is unique in its ability to promote the development and selection of naïve T cells with a repertoire purged of vital ""Self"" specificities but prepared to react to injurious ""Non-Self"". Essential for this competence are thymic epithelial cells (TEC). These constitute the major component of the thymic stroma and are categorized into separate cortical (c) and medullary (m) lineages based on their specific molecular, structural and functional characteristics. cTEC attract blood-borne precursor cells, commit them to a T cell fate, foster their differentiation and positively select cells that express a T cell antigen receptor (TCR) of sufficient affinity for self-antigens. Subsequently, both cTEC and mTEC deplete thymocytes that display a TCR with significant reactivity to self-antigens, a process known as negative selection, authorizing the generation of a diversified T cell repertoire with versatile antigen-recognition capacity. TEC differentiation and growth are dependent on the expression of the transcription factor FOXN1, a master regulator required for normal TEC biology. The precise molecular and cellular mechanisms that control TEC formation, their differentiation into separate lineages, their life-long homeostatic maintenance and the preservation of their complex function are, however, only incompletely understood. Detailed knowledge of the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that control regular TEC biology will therefore provide important insight into an essential component of the adaptive immune system.This research proposal (i) seeks to identify distinct cellular stage in cTEC and mTEC maturation, respectively, and probe the genetic control that commends their differentiation (Specific Aim 1); (ii) explores the role of the proteasome component &#946;5t, a target of FOXN1 (Specific Aim 2); and (iii) elucidates the plasticity in mTEC development as a function of epigenetic regulation (Specific Aim 3). 1.2. Working Hypothesis The proposed research is based on the testable hypotheses that the differentiation of thymic epithelia into the functionally separate cortical and medullary lineages is instructed by specific genetic circuits that require FOXN1-mediated target gene expression in conjunction with the correct placement of epigenetic marks. 1.3. Specific Aims:#1: To identify the genetic control of TEC differentiation into distinct cortical and medullary linages #2: To investigate the role of Psmb11, a developmentally regulated Foxn1 target gene, in cTEC function#3: To examine the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)-independent pathway of mTEC differentiation 1.4. Expected Value of the Proposed ProjectThe proposed research will establish in unprecedented molecular details the mechanisms important in TEC lineage differentiation and function. Specifically, information gained from the outlined studies will allow a refined understanding of the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms operative in regular TEC biology. This insight is not only essential to appreciate the immune systems' competence to establish tolerance to ""Self"" whilst maintaining an ability to generate a protective response to ""Non-Self"" but is also fundamental for the design of efforts aimed in the immediate future to regenerate thymus function in the context of congenital and acquired deficiencies.

Patients suffer from progressive muscle wasting,respiratory and cardiac impairments, and premature death. DMD is the mostfrequent hereditary muscular dystrophy. Currently, only symptomatic treatmentwith glucocorticoids is available; these have limited efficacy but many adverseeffects. The European Medical agency (EMA) and the US Federal drug agency(FDA) recognize the unmet medical need in DMD.Most current research on therapeutics of DMD focuses on correcting the genedefect. However, as there are more than 250 mutations in the human dystrophingene, this approach will treat only a small percentage of patients and will beexpensive, i.e. kEuro 100-250 per patient per year as compared to tamoxifen (TAM)(about kEuro 0.3). Using the mouse DMD model, our partners in Geneva Dorchieset al. have shown that TAM, given orally for periods of 2 or 15 months at dosesas low as 0.3 mg/kg/day, resulted in almost full recovery of force and structureof muscles. Very similar, yet unpublished, results have been obtained in thelaboratory of Professor D. Wells in London. TAM is likely the most efficaciouscompounds ever investigated in an animal model of DMD (for a comparison,see Ruegg 2013). TAM is a drug used since 1980 to treat breast cancer andhormonal disorders in pre-pubertal boys, too. There is broad clinical evidenceand reliable data suggesting a very good safety profile.Our aim is to investigate whether TAM treatment, compared to placebo, reducesthe disease progression in DMD patients. The project has been reviewed by EUfunded international TREAT-NMD (TACT) initiative. The project and studydesign has been discussed with DMD parent / patients organisations ofSwitzerland, Germany, the Netherlands, and the US who all strongly support theneed for such trial. The project will be presented to the European MedicinesAgency (EMA) to obtain an orphan drug designation (ODD) and to get formalscientific advice (by a specialised agency called EUDRAC). We plan a 48-weekplacebo controlled randomised clinical trial with 65 ambulant (6.5-10 year old)DMD patients (under stable standard treatment of care with glucocorticoids).Patients will receive daily 10 mg of TAM or placebo. The definitive primaryendpoint will be chosen after final scientific advice obtained from the EMA.Based on our power analyses, the highest effect size (and lowest patientnumber to be included) is the motor function measure (MFM) subscore D1(standing and transfers) which, therefore, is so far foreseen as primaryendpoint. Other considered clinical endpoints (and so far secondary) include theNorth Star Ambulant Assessment, timed function tests, and quantitative muscletesting. To investigate whether long-term 48-week TAM treatment can slowmuscle degeneration, we will measure the muscle fat fraction using quantitativemuscle magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) (Bonati et al. 2015). We will closelycollaborate with ECRIN and its local partner, the Clinical Trial Unit (CTU) of theUniversity Hospital Basel. The CTU's personal will manage the project, set upthe database (eCRF), monitor the trial and is responsible for statistical analysesof the study results. All partners contributing to this trial have broad experiencein caring for DMD patients and have already been involved in clinical studies.Together we care for about 150 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria.

"Jenal, Urs",NA,Departement Biozentrum / Growth & Development; Departement Biozentrum / Infection Biology; Departement Biozentrum / Molecular Microbiology (Jenal),Tolerance as a potential reservoir for the development of drug resistance,2017,"Abstract The widespread use of antibiotics promotes the spread of existing resistance mechanisms and the evolution of novel resistance traits. While resistant microorganisms are able to grow in the presence of the antibiotic, drug tolerance and drug persistence allow survival during transient antibiotic treatment windows. The mechanisms responsible for drug tolerance and persistence are currently unknown, representing a major obstacle for the development of anti-persistence drugs and other intervention strategies to cure persistent bacterial infection and interfere with resistance development. The often rare and transient nature of the multi-drug tolerant phenotype represents a particular challenge for the experimental and clinical exploration of persisting bacteria calling for a concerted and multi-pronged research approach to uncover their specific properties, clinical significance, and possible eradication strategies. While drug persistence mechanisms have been pioneered primarily in E. coli, it remains unclear how universal these features are. Importantly, it is also unclear if tolerance or persistence relates to the emergence of resistance traits and what their relevance is in the human patient.  To uncover the different mechanisms of antibiotic survival and their implications for resistance development, we use Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an important human pathogen causing both acute and chronic infections. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that 1) high levels of tolerance and persistence rapidly evolve in P. aeruginosapopulations challenged with different classes of antibiotics; 2) evolution of high-level persistence always precedes resistance development; and 3) increased persistence is transient in a situation where resistance development is possible (single drug treatment) but is sustained in situations where resistance development is not possible (multi-drug treatment). These studies indicated that i) rapid evolution of high level persistence facilitates the emergence of drug resistance; and that ii) persistence alone (without resistance) can promote prolonged survival during drug treatment regimes. This is highly relevant as it suggests that populations of pathogens in human patients treated with antibiotics can rapidly evolve high levels of persistence to survive, thereby representing a reservoir for the selection of drug resistance traits.  To reach a better understanding of the molecular and physiological basis of drug tolerance and of the stochastic emergence of persister cells we propose to address the following three key questions: 1) Does increased tolerance facilitate the fixation of drug resistance? 2) What are the mechanisms of drug tolerance and persistence in the model pathogen P. aeruginosa? 3) How relevant is drug tolerance in the human patient? Our goals are to identify mechanisms of drug tolerance employed by P. aeruginosaand to outline the dynamic relationship between acquisition of tolerance and resistance both in vitroand in the patient. Results from this proposal will fill fundamental knowledge gaps about the core and accessory characteristics of persisters, develop improved biomarkers for persistence and illuminate new avenues for therapeutic intervention through anti-persister antibiotic administration protocols. For these purposes, we will combine experimental evolution of laboratory and clinical P. aeruginosastrains with global analysis tools to investigate which strategies the bacterium employs to gradually overcome the challenge by different classes of antibiotics. Deep-genome sequencing of evolved lineages will be performed in order to follow the mutation acquired by the bacterial population and the dynamics of the clonal diversification over time. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting coupled to proteome analysis will be used to characterized discrete sub-populations displaying distinct phenotypes while single cell behaviours will be visualized by real-time microfluidic microscopy. The utilisation of descriptive and predictive quantitative models integrating the covariance between proteomic profiles and quantifiable microbial antibiotic parameters such as MICs, persistence and tolerance scores will shed light on the physiological basis of the bacterial response to drug treatment. We will extend these analyses to clincal P. aeruginosaisolates with the aim of defining general signatures and a comprehensive physiological model for persistence.   ","Antibiotic resistance, tolerance, persistence, Pseudomonas aeruginosa",external_funding,Completed,4237202,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,105,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Vast amounts of this gas are produced in natural wetlands and lakes. The multiple factors that control the balance between CH4 production and consumption, and in turn regulate the emission to the atmosphere, are still not fully understood. With this proposal, we seek funding for a continuation of SNF projects 121861 and 137636, the main objectives of which were to understand the modes of, and controls on, CH4 oxidation in the hypolimnion of eutrophic Lake Lugano. The previous efforts provided evidence for high rates of CH4 oxidation below the oxic-anoxic interface, which was primarily attributed to micro-aerobic CH4oxidation within the redox-transition zone in the mid-hypolimnion. Due to this efficient biological filter, only traces of CH4 from the sediments escape into the upper water column of the lake. However, our previous work also revealed subsurface accumulations of CH4 at the thermocline, leading to its net emissions from the lake surface into the atmosphere (up to 4600 mol day-1). The ""methane paradox"", i.e., the persistent CH4 supersaturation in oxic waters, was previously reported also for other lakes and the ocean, implying some unknown source of CH4 directly in the upper water column of these environments. The C-isotopic signature of subsurface CH4 in Lake Lugano points to biologic origin, yet the mechanisms leading to its formation remain unclear. The proposed research will aim at testing concurrent hypotheses with regards to the potential source of epilimnetic CH4, and at understanding the controls on the spatio-temporal dynamics of CH4 accumulation in Lake Lugano. Combining field and laboratory measurements, along with the employment of stable isotopic, radio-label, and molecular analyses, we will test for: i) CH4 production in association with phytoplankton productivity and anoxic microsites in sinking organic matter, ii) anaerobic CH4 production within the digestive tracts of zooplankton, and iii) the light-induced decomposition of dissolved organic carbon (photomethanification). We will specifically investigate CH4 production related to the exploitation (as nutrient source) and decomposition of methylated organic compounds. Some of these compounds (e.g., methylphosphonate and dimethylsulphoniopropionate) have been identified as components of phytoplankton biomass and/or metabolites during phytoplankton growth in the ocean, but their relevance in lacustrine ecosystems is unknown. Possible association between methanogens and zooplankton and/or phytoplankton aggregates will be elucidated by functional gene and lipid biomarker analysis. We will verify anticipated links between epilimnetic CH4 accumulation, the production of methylated compounds and other substrates used during methanogenesis, as well as trophic state (i.e., nutrient availability), phytoplankton productivity and community structure. Alternative explanations for the epilimnetic CH4 accumulations (e.g., transport of CH4 from the littoral zone and dissolution of CH4 bubbles) will also be examined. We hypothesize that the epilimnetic CH4 is primarily produced in situ, and that the release of CH4 into subsurface waters of Lake Lugano is modulated by the seasonal cycle of biological production and respiration. The proposed research will result in the first comprehensive characterization of epilimnetic CH4 production in a deep alpine lake. It will provide a milestone in our efforts to understand the ""methane paradox"" in lakes, helping us to gain insight into the biogeochemical controls on global CH4 emissions from terrestrial and aquatic environments. Finally, established links between CH4 production and biological productivity in the modern lake can provide the basis for temporal extrapolation.

It circulates around the globe and engages policy makers as well as human rights activists. After capturing the imagination of the biggest players in the field, it has attracted massive funding. And as a crucial principle of the Sustainable Development Goals 2015-2030, it can be expected to do so in the future. Anthropologists tend to share the emancipatory and humanitarian concerns implicit in 'participation'. At the same time, they have become highly critical of the ways in which this popular buzzword is used in contemporary development speak and produce a growing body of empirical evidence about the ambivalences, dilemma and paradoxes created by participatory planning, policies and programs. This project examines 'participation' in the emergent field of 'social health protection'. In order to reach their goal of Universal Health Coverage, the International Labor Office, the World Bank and the World Health Organization push social health protection as a key strategy. They come up with diverse measures of public and publicly organized health financing measures for Low and Middle Income Countries, some of which are implemented through 'induced participation' and collective forms of 'organic participation'. The massive attention given to efforts of inducing participation bears the danger of not only obscuring but perhaps even destroying people's omnipresent but less visible strife for social participation in family and kin networks and self-organized groups to protect their health and improve their life condition. Contemporary Tanzania presents a particularly interesting case for studying participation in social health protection in this broader sense because of her long engagement with changing forms of participatory development and the government's current aspiration to transform Tanzania into a middle-income country with Universal Health Coverage. The project thus aims at demonstrating that participation in diverse forms of social health protection can be conceived as a social practice which configures and is reconfigured by broader societal and material orders. Combining a multi-level analysis with in-depth ethnographic field research the project will explore understudied aspects in current research on induced and organic participation and thus contribute to transforming current development perspectives on social and societal change. The project thus aims at contributing to three major emerging fields: First, to the growing research interest in an 'anthropology of the good' through its emphasis on the ways in which people engage with each other to make a 'better life'. Secondly, to the newly evolving 'anthropology of insurance' through its combined multi-level analysis and in-depth ethnographic research on social health protection as a social practice. Third, by engaging in a public dialogue, we hope that our insights will be discussed, contested, and appropriated by some of these 'stakeholders' and thus make a difference in the comprehension of the important contemporary issues of social health protection reform and more general societal change.","Participation, community health insurance, Tanzania",external_funding,Completed,3623911,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,109,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

While there is continuously increased Hg deposition in China, the deposition rate of Hg has been decreased since 1960s in Switzerland. In this study, we propose a collaborative project to investigate Hg biogeochemical behaviour in the remote forested ecosystems in Switzerland and China to understand how different chronologies of Hg deposition impact Hg biogeochemistry in remote forest ecosystems with a specific focus on atmosphere-land exchange of Hg. We will characterise the profile distribution of Hg at both sites to reveal at which horizons the recently and historically deposited Hg tends to accumulate. Using isotope dilution technique, we will quantify the pool of exchangeable Hg in soils. We will perform the first ever research to quantify gaseous elemental mercury (Hg(0), GEM) fluxes above and below the forest canopy utilising REA and dynamic flux chamber at both sites, in addition to mass balance analysis of Hg. This approach will complete our understanding on Hg biogeochemical cycles in the terrestrial environments at Chinese and Swiss sites. Mesocosm systems with litterfall, O layers and subsoils will be carried out to measure Hg reemission and leaching from soils at the Chinese and Swiss sites under manipulated precipitation, temperatures, biological activities and irradiance to examine how environmental factors affect Hg reemission and leaching from litterfall, O layers and subsoils at both sites. We will also measure Hg isotope compositions of Hg in atmospheric Hg, wet precipitation, litterfall, soils and bedrock at both sites to assess Hg sources along the soil profile to gain more insights into historical changes in deposition sources at both Chinese and Swiss sites. In mesocosm systems, the magnitude and direction of Hg isotope change during incubation will be utilised to identify possible Hg reduction pathways in soils and furthermore to elucidate how the pathway of Hg reduction in litterfall, O layers and subsoils. The proposed research will deliver quantitative information on the air-land exchange of Hg in forest ecosystems with distinct Hg deposition fluxes at the two study sites. This information is crucial for better understanding of global cycling of Hg in the environment, and has the potential in understanding how effective the implementation of the Minimata Convention will curb the process of recovery from Hg accumulation not only in China but also in Europe and North America.",NA,external_funding,Completed,3701418,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,110,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE

However, for Central Europe, and notably for northern Switzerland and adjacent regions, only limited quantitative information is available on the amplitude of temperature changes during large sections of the past 130,000 years. Based on fossil chironomid records from sites in the northern Alpine region of Switzerland and adjacent regions, this project will develop a new palaeotemperature dataset that describes long-term (millennial-scale) summer temperature changes during this time interval. The presently available chironomid-temperature transfer function for the Alpine region will be expanded by analysing an additional 40 lakes to make it suitable for July air temperature reconstruction based on fossil chironomids in late Quaternary sediments from northern Alpine lowland and mid-elevation lakes. New Lateglacial chironomid records from two sites in Switzerland will be developed. Together with reconstructed temperatures obtained from previously analysed chironomid records in the study region, these data will be used to calculate a multi-site reconstruction of summer temperature change during the past 18,000 years. In collaboration with partner projects, new chironomid-based July air temperature reconstructions will also be developed from two lakes in southern Germany close to the Swiss border, covering the time interval of ca. 130,000-40,000 and ca. 40,000-14,000 years ago, respectively. Combined these records will describe July air temperature variations in the study region at multimillennial- to millennial-scale for the interval 130,000-18,000 years ago and at millennial- to multicentennial-scale for the past 18,000 years. The project will produce the first reconstruction of July air temperature change from central Europe covering a full interglacial-glacial-interglacial cycle based on a standardized and consistent methodology, and the longest chironomid-based temperature reconstruction available to date. It will therefore provide the user community (e.g., archaeologists, palaeoecologists, glaciologists, vegetation and climate modellers) with a new, high-quality palaotemperature dataset for the northern Alpine region.

The virus transmission in urban environments is very complex and the mechanisms and determinants of the transmission of viruses in the urban population have not been fully understood. This project aims at understanding the possible transmission paths of influenza infections within the urban context. It is assumed that geographic spreading patterns of influenza may help identify causes as well as transmission paths of the viruses which in turn may assist in formulating preventative measures. Core element of this research endeavor therefore is a large research network from the fields of Medicine, Life Sciences, Infectious Diseases, Social Geography and Ecology, Clinical Microbiology and Medical Statistics, capable of analyzing the geographic and microbiological-molecular-genetic dimensions of influenza transmission and modelling the transmission mathematically and statistically.   Inter-disciplinary, inter-faculty, inter-institutional research approach. A unique feature of the research project then is its interdisciplinary, interfaculty, inter-institutional approach through cooperation of the fields of Medicine, Environmental Sciences and Biosystems Engineering, particularly the following: at the University Hospital Basel: the Emergency Department, the Division of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, the Division of Clinical Microbiology, the Clinical Trial Unit at the Department of Clinical Research, the Blood Donation Center, and at the University of Basel: Applied Microbiological Research at the Department of Biomedicine, the Department of Environmental Sciences Human Geography Research Group, and the Institute of General Practice Medicine.

Household Survey - Determinants of the influenza vaccine uptake in Basel   analyses vaccine uptake, vaccine coverage, health behavior, perceptions on vaccination and other preventative measures, source of health information differences according to urban quarters, person specific variables (e.g. age, gender, place of residence) and reported behaviors and perceptions.    2 Medical, microbiological approaches  analyse the transmission network of the influenza virus using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) genetic information of the pathogens and how they spread and mutate within the city context.    3 The biosystems science and engineering approach uses mathematical modelling to  develop mathematical models for influenza transmission understand the transmission patterns of the influenza pathogen and simulate preventative measures in the model.    Relevance. Influenza viruses adapt rapidly to the host immune system. Due to the constant change the virus can escape the targeted immune response and thereby create an opportunity to spread, causing every winter epidemics. The adaption happens through small genetic transformations. Therefore, the immunological protection acquired is only short-lived. The frequency of influenza cases does not only depend on a single individual but also on the population as a whole. Putting disease incidences into a spatial context contributes to the understanding of transmission paths of influenza in an urban context. It has not been intensely investigated if there is a connection between influenza incidences in an urban space and aspects of the urban environment as well as the different quarter structures, but it is considered likely, and this is the focus of this interdisciplinary, interfaculty, interinstitutional project","nfluenza vaccination, influenza vaccination coverage, vaccination uptake, vaccination determinants, Influenza vaccination, influenza vaccination coverage, vaccination uptake, vaccination determinants, Switzerland, Basel",external_funding,Completed,3542995,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,113,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Because of their high rate of evolution and excellent geological record over millions of years these organisms are unique for testing questions about evolutionary theory. In the present project we focus on the morphological evolution of the Neogene planktic foraminiferal plexus of Globorotalia menardii during the past 8 million years in the tropical belt of the Indian Ocean and Pacific and the southern to equatorial Atlantic. This investigation is a continuation of our general research agenda studying the paleobiogeography of morphological evolution and speciation of calcareous pelagic microfossils. By comparing the morphological trends of test variation of this group from carefully selected ODP sites in the tropical West Pacific and southwestern Indian Ocean with cores from the eastern tropical Atlantic and the Cape Basin off South Africa the possibility of large scale dispersal of G. menardii and associated tropical faunas from the Indian or Pacific oceans around the southern tip of Africa will be evaluated. The Agulhas Current System has repeatedly introduced tropical plankton faunas from the Indian Ocean into the South-Atlantic since at least the Pleistocene (so called Agulhas Leakage Faunas). From our past work on deep-sea cores from Céara Rise in the tropical West-Atlantic and from the Caribbean Sea it is suspected, that Agulhas leakage of menardiform globorotalids possibly reached back until about 1.95 Ma (Late Pliocene), which will be tested here. The seeding of menardiform faunas by the Agulhas Current System is thought to be identifiable through morphological divergence of their shells between oceans: A slow and gradual pattern of shell size increase is expected in the western Pacific and Indian Ocean, while rapid increase of shell size in the large but rarer adult size fraction is expected along the pathway of Agulhas leakage eddies in the South-Atlantic that may reach into equatorial latitudes of the Atlantic. Methodologically the investigation is realized by digital image analysis and traditional geometric morphometry. Routine image collection of menardiform shells is done by using our microfossil orientation and imaging robot called AMOR (Automated Measurement system for shell mORphology), which was jointly built with the Institute for Automation of the University of Applied Sciences of Northwestern Switzerland.

Typical applications in- clude ultrasound imaging, wireless communications and seismic tomography. In this proposal we shall analyze and further develop time integration methods for the numerical simulation of acoustic, electromagnetic or elastic wave phenomena. For the spatial discretization, we use either conforming finite elements or discontinuous Galerkin methods, which accomodate arbitrary meshes and geometry. For the time discretization, we consider recently derived local time-stepping (LTS) methods, which overcome the bottleneck due to local mesh refinement by taking smaller time-steps precisely where the smallest elements are located.  Explicit LTS methods have already proved useful in many applications and shown nearly optimal speed-up on HPC architectures. Convergence (in the ODE sense) to the semi-discrete solution on a fixed mesh is fairly standard. However, a general convergence theory in the PDE sense, which establishes convergence to the (true) continuous solution as both the time-step and the mesh-size tend to zero, is still lacking.  This proposal therefore aims at establishing a rigourous convergence theory for explicit LTS meth- ods, which fall into two separate categories. Hence this proposal consists of two separate projects. In the first project, we shall prove optimal space-time convergence of LTS methods based on energy conserving leap-frog (LF) methods. Moreover, we shall compare the accuracy of different fourth-order LTS methods in particular for long-time simulations. In the second project, we shall derive a complete space-time convergence theory for Runge-Kutta (RK) based LTS methods.

They aid to answer important research questions related to health, well-being,functioning and behaviour of various populations and institutions. This type of readilyavailable data is valuable for many disciplines including medicine, psychology, andsociology. It holds the potential to have a direct impact on quality and cost-efficiency ofhealth care as validated by real time use of Big Data in smarter healthcare and citiesprojects.As research regulations have been originally conceived for clinical trials, researcherscarrying out studies that use EHR and SM face considerable uncertainty. Recently, thepublic has reacted strongly to the perception that research involving data andbiological samples (generating genetic data) is underregulated and therefore data abuseis becoming a high risk. Big Data research has opened previously unprecedentedpossibilities of data research and has increasingly highlighted public fears of abuse:predictive analysis of EHR is being developed for so-called smarter hospitals to helpidentify in real time patients at high risk for health deterrioration. Models based onalgorithms are developed to predict and address healthcare and resource allocation insmarter hospitals. In medicine and psychology, routine data from EHR offer thepotential to use data from millions of people to answer important research questions atmuch lower cost than clinical trials. Combination of information from SM, consumerdata (e.g. data from the Migros Cumulus card) and EHR data could enable in findingobjectivable results that were previously only available through more costly subjectivetools such as patient or consumer questionnaires.This type of very promising Big Data research raises new technical and regulatoryconcerns due to its specific characteristics: the vast amount (variety, volume) of usefuldata generated at an unprecedented speed (velocity) encompassing not only medicalinformation but also sociodemographic and financial data. It thus presents challengeson veracity at various levels of data flow, ranging from the extraction of information todata sharing and methods of data management and analysis. Among the mostpressing ethical and regulatory concerns are issues of consent, privacy, confidentialityand conflicts of interest. Countries are struggeling individually and often differentlywith the regulatory void, and the varying domestic approaches lead to concerningbarriers for international research. In Switzerland, it is at present not always clearwhich type of Big Data research is considered human subject research and mustreceive approval from cantonal research ethics committees (CRECs). Furthermore,CRECs lack capacities to treat all research from such grey zones, especially if they aredone outside of medical faculties. Some researchers have sought to address thisshortcoming by enacting their own department or faculty commissions to approveresearch. These commissions, in contrast to the CRECs, do not have a legal status and their competence and scope remain undefined.The past has shown that if research remains largely unregulated there is a risk ofpublic ""backfire"". Citizens' fear of abuse and of research taking place ""behind theirbacks"" can create the feeling that regulations must be particularly strict.

"Simon, Michael","Zuniga, Franziska; De Geest, Sabina M.; Nicca, Dunja",Departement Public Health / Pflegewissenschaft (Simon),Nurse-led care model in Swiss nursing homes: improving INTERprofessional CARE for better resident outcomes (INTERCARE),2017,"Background  The increasing complexity of medical care in nursing homes and the lack of coordination between settings jeopardize nursing home (NH) care quality. One particularly disturbing issue are avoidable hospitalizations, associated with potential negative clinical and psychosocial outcomes and excess cost. For older, frail persons, hospitalizations can increase mortality, functional decline, delirium, and falls. Between 19% and 67% of hospitalizations from NHs might be preventable [1]. Possible reasons are NH staff members' limited capacity to detect and react to early changes in chronic conditions that commonly lead to hospitalization, the lack of advanced care planning with residents and family in end-of-life situations, and the limited access to primary care physicians / geriatricians and first diagnostic procedures in emergency situations [2-4]. This calls for new models of care to support NH care quality by enhancing care coordination, improving care workers' geriatric expertise (including the use of advanced practice nurses (ANP) and expert nurses), and investing in effective (clinical) leadership in NH [5, 6]. One promising solution, well-established in other countries, but still to be implemented and tested in Switzerland, are nurse-led interprofessional care NH models. These models have shown to improve resident satisfaction, to empower NH staff, as well as clinical outcomes including a reduction in avoidable hospitalizations [5, 7-9]. Moreover, they are typically led by APN or expert nurses and focus on residents' needs assessment, care coordination (also in view of transitions between settings), provide geriatric clinical leadership and support data-driven quality improvement [8]. APN training opportunities have only recently been introduced in Switzerland and their roles are still in development. Several barriers might hinder the implementation of these new roles, such as the lack of organizational understanding or unclear roles and competencies. Accordingly, before implementation, it is necessary to define the APN's context, role, scope, goals, core competencies and expected impact with all relevant stakeholders [10, 11]. The main goal of the INTERCARE study is therefore to develop and evaluate a Swiss nurse-led interprofessional care NH model to improve care coordination and quality of care in NHs with a special focus on the reduction of avoidable hospitalizations.  Methodology  The project will have two stages: Stage A for the development, Stage B for the implementation and evaluation of the nurse-led care model. In Stage A, a 'Swiss nurse-led interprofessional NH care model' will be developed based on available international evidence, contextual information from existing local Swiss models and stakeholder involvement according to the principles of Public Patient Involvement. The 'Swiss nurse-led interprofessional NH care model', a multi-level complex intervention, will consist of core and peripheral components, the latter to be adaptable to the local context during the implementation phase (Stage B). Anticipated core components of the 'Swiss nurse-led interprofessional NH care model' are nurse experts with an expanded geriatric practice, advanced clinical leadership and competencies as well as administrative backing, which will be prepared with educational trainings and continuous coaching throughout the intervention period together with the NH leadership. The definitive content of the 'Swiss nurse-led interprofessional NH care model' at the end of stage A will be the resultant of the input of the different stakeholders and the contextual analysis guided by two frameworks (the PEPPA+ framework used for the evaluation of APN roles and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) guiding the implementation of the new care model) as well as the RAND/UCLA methodology. In Stage B, using a quasi experimental step wedged design (21 months) the 'Swiss nurse-led interprofessional NH care model' will be implemented and tested in a convenience sample of 12 NHs across Switzerland's German- and French-speaking regions.    We aim to assess the effectiveness of the nurse-led care model on unplanned hospitalizations (primary outcome) and additional resident and staff outcomes, hypothesizing that nursing homes with a nurse-led care model have lower rates of unplanned hospitalizations and show improvements in resident and staff outcomes. Furthermore, we assess the effect of the degree of the model's adoption on client outcomes, hypothesizing that a higher degree of adoption is related to better client outcomes.

All three cancers have the same histological appearance and are diagnosed and treated the same way. However, knowledge is increasing that whilst all three arise via p53 mutations, they origin from different sites and have different genetic drivers. Whilst STC/SOC is defined by having the biggest tumor volume in the tubes/ovaries and only metastatic disease in the omentum, SPC presents with massive omental tumor-load with no invasion into the ovaries or tubes. Until now, there are no published data to support a different origin for SPC because it seems to be specifically located in the omentum. However, unpublished work from us has shown a revolutionary result: on genetic, proteomic and glycomic level, STC/SOC are distinct to SPC and should therefore be diagnosed and especially treated individually. Correct classification of these cancers, identifying the place of origin and their distinct development would change the paradigm that they are all the same disease which is relevant for the treatment regime and possible survival of women.Since SPC develops specifically in the omentum, we aim to (a) reveal the human omental structure in situ and (b) to design, based on the in-situ information, a relevant 3D human model mimicking the development of SPC.Like the omentum, the fallopian tubes and ovaries are covered by mesothelial cells with submesothelial vascular and lymphatic networks where resident macrophages mature; a robust 3D in vivo-like model, which allows the assessment of cancer cell mesothelial clearance and invasion as well as stem cell population studies has not been designed before and is highly innovative. We will use native tissue and for the first-time tissue-engineered omentum including 3D cell printing technology. Molecular analyses will be performed by deconstructing and reconstructing both omental models, systematically exposing the structures to normal tubal epithelial and serous tubal cancer cells.

It will also form a basis for novel and expanded theranostic strategies due to co-entrapment of fluorescent molecules with large DNA payloads. This capability will, on one hand, enable the delivery of theranostic gene circuits; on the other hand, the entrapment of fluorescent dyes will enable facile readout of particle delivery in time and space that does not rely on gene expression.

In answering this question, I provide an in-depth account of the relation between Kant's views about what animals are and his views about how we ought to treat them. By bringing together Kant's philosophy with the newest advances in the philosophy of animal minds and animal agency, I then provide a new framework for animal ethics which I call the Ethics of Respect.Realisation: The project answers its central question in two steps spanning three semesters each: First, it corrects Kant's rather crude views about what animals are and what their capabilities are. In Kant's view, animals lack practical reason and are steered wholly by behavioral automatisms - a view I criticize and replace with a pluralist view of animal practical capabilities. Secondly, the project accordingly corrects Kant's views on how we morally ought to treat animals. In the course of taking the second step, the project outlines the moral philosophy Kant should have defended had he not been oblivious to the extent and diversity of animal practical capabilities - the Ethics of Respect. This is effectively a Kantian system of ethics equipped with tools from the philosophy of animal minds and animal agency to deal with moral questions relating to animals.

In this doctoral thesis neural modifications with regard to authenticity are investigated thoroughly and based on a profound analysis of the concept of authenticity. In the first part a genealogy of authenticity will be compiled, to show how the concept developed and became a virtue as well as to illustrate the different functions and interpretations that have been ascribed to the concept. Moreover, authenticity will be differentiated from related concepts such as autonomy or identity via this historical exposition.

Aging is associated with a progressive decline in numerous physiological processes, leading to an increased risk of health complications and disease. Aging is the most important determinant of a person's cardiovascular health: aging remarkably affects the heart and arterial system and is considered one of the major risk factors for the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) including atherosclerosis, hypertension, myocardial infarction and stroke. Another major risk factor for CVD is obesity, and evidence supports also that obesity may accelerate the aging process. A very important cellular process crucial to cardiovascular health is proteostasis. This refers to a collection of cellular processes handling protein folding, misfolding, unfolding, and degradation, and it is fundamental to cell survival and function. Both aging and obesity lead to gradual dysfunction and collapse of the proteostasis network. Thus, it is now clear that not only are aging, obesity and proteostasis malfunction per se pivotal in development and progression of CVD, they also profoundly impact each other (Fig. 1).

Despite recent achievements in X-ray crystallography of GPCRs, the high-resolution structures obtained do not capture their intrinsic dynamic properties, which are tightly associated with their function. NMR spectroscopy promises to provide such missing dynamic information. However so far, despite being valuable, only limited information has been obtained by NMR due to the difficult spectroscopic properties of this protein class. At this point, the potential of solution NMR analysis of GPCRs has not been fully realized. Recently, I have overcome many of the obstacles that hinder the application of solution NMR to study signal transduction in GPCRs. Using a stabilized form of the &#946;1 -adrenergic receptor and a selective isotope labeling method in the baculovirus-insect cell expression system, I was able to acquire well-resolved backbone amide proton-nitrogen correlation spectra. These spectra revealed numerous mechanisms within the receptor that are new, or had been postulated but never observed directly. Thus I have established a system that can now be used to study many more functional mechanisms of GPCRs at atomic resolution. In addition, we have developed an economic method to produce uniformly isotope-labeled (including deuteration) GPCRs in the insect cell systems. This will allow more advanced applications of NMR spectroscopy to GPCRs such as the study of their dynamics by relaxation measurements. In the present proposal I want to use this system to obtain detailed insights into the receptor's signal transmission mechanism with the aim to understand how the receptor recognizes ligands and passes this information to the G protein in order to modulate its activity. Using state-of-the-art methods of isothermal titration calorimetry, protein rigidity theory, coevolutionary sequence alignment, in vitro real-time observation of GDP/GTP exchange by fluorescence as well as solution NMR, I want to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism of the thermodynamic behavior of ligand-receptor interactions, determine a high-resolution allosteric network model of signal transmission, and provide mechanical insights into how different agonists elicit varying levels of G protein activation.

This is evidenced by the concept's centrality in the OECD's Development Assistance Committee's agenda, and its inclusion in the World Bank's 2011 World Development Report as well as the Swiss government's 2013-2016 Message on International Cooperation. While policymakers have frequently linked fragility to a range of humanitarian concerns and trans­national security threats (cf. McLoughlin 2012), research organizations such as The Fund for Peace have developed indexes that provide a gloomy outlook on the state(s) of the world. This applies particularly to Africa, which is summarily judged to be ""undoubtedly plagued by systematic state failure"" (Howard 2014), and which is allegedly home to 30 out of a total of 49 fragile states in the world (OECD 2015). However, Burkina Faso's huge successes towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), Tanzania's notable political stability, Botswana's stunning economic progress, Zambia's completely peaceful development, and the fact that out of 54 African countries more than half have neither experienced internal nor intrastate war between 1947 and 2015 (UCDP/PRIO 2015; see also Lindemann 2008), all call such blanket propositions on 'the African state' into question. Thus, and given that the alleged structural causes of fragility-ranging from arbitrary colonial borders (Herbst 2000) to widespread poverty and inequality (Sachs 2003)-are widely shared among African countries, the real puzzle is not necessarily why so many countries have succumbed to fragility, but why numerous African states have not. Framed differently, the central question motivating this research project is how differences in state trajectories in Africa can be explained, and under what conditions it is state-making or state-breaking that prevails. The project hypothesizes that a defining characteristic of state trajectories lies in the process of 'rule standardization'. It proposes that whereas states of fragility are marked by a plurality of coexisting institutions (i.e. 'rules of the game') and identities (i.e. 'rules of the mind'), resilient states have witnessed a process whereby such rules came to be standardized across a politically defined territory and its population. While this novel analytical lens provides the project's originality, its rationale lies in gaining a more nuanced understanding of state-making and its underlying currents. Informed by historical sociology and political economy, and framed in the language of institutions, this research advances theoretical and empirical insights into state dynamics, not least by bringing issues of social cohesion and identity formation back into debates on state-making. Unlike many past studies of fragility, which have generally treated cases of fragile statehood in isolation and exhibited insufficient variation on the dependent variable, this project avoids such methodological flaws by proposing a comparative case studies research design. Accordingly, a few carefully selected pairs of African countries that are marked by divergent state trajectories will be subject to in-depth research and comparative analysis-both within and across pairs. This not only promises to provide a better understanding of why and under what conditions fragile statehood does (not) occur, but also allows to rethink processes of state-making and -breaking more generally.",state fragility; state-building; nation-building; sub-Sahara Africa,external_funding,Completed,3774035,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,129,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

The Namib fog is generally of marine origin and advected on shore either directly as fog or as stratus clouds which intercept with the ground at a higher elevation further inland. Correlation between spatial distribution of the flora and fauna and the occurrence of Namib fog is documented in numerous studies. However, knowledge about the spatial and temporal patterns of fog distribution is incomplete and, in particular, the amount of fog water deposition available to the fauna and flora is unknown. Fog precipitation measurements with fog collectors in the Namib have been carried out but no physically sound method to convert them to fog water deposition is available. The lack of observations of cloud physical properties of Namib fog prevents a thorough understanding of fog water deposition processes and their relevance for the water budget. The proposed sub-project NaFoLiCA-F has two key aspects:  Characterization of ecosystem water availability in the Namib, with a focus on fog as a source of water. The unsolved question how to scale sampled fog precipitation to fog water deposition is addressed. Fog water deposition is determined with two independent methods, i.e. the eddy covariance approach where the vertical flux of liquid water is directly measured and the use of micro-lysimeters where fog water deposition is derived by weighing a piece of soil. Existing fog collectors and a new fog collector with a higher collection efficiency developed within the project will be calibrated and scaled to give an estimate of fog water deposition. Together with the existing comprehensive micrometeorological data-set (FogNet stations, the UNIBAS flux tower, the BSRN station) and the results of the planned Intensive Observation Period (IOP), we are confident to provide a parameterization for this highly important open question. Create a basic data-set from ground-based measurements (permanent stations, one IOP). Provide data to partner projects NaFoLiCA-M and NaFoLiCA-S for the fine- tuning of different empirical parameters for a numerical fog forecast model and for the development and refining of fog related satellite remote sensing techniques.  Process understanding will be advanced by analyzing the life cycle stages of individual fog events, i.e. the temporal and spatial development of fog micro- and macro-physical properties including a characterization of liquid water distribution within the fog vertical profile. The proposed research crosses scales: from the microphysical processes level to the landscape-scale spatial patterns, and from fog property changes within minutes to seasonal patterns and multi-year trends. Taken together, the component projects are expected to greatly improve the understanding of Namib fog as a paradigm of coastal-desert fog phenomena.

Further East, mine tailings in and around Johannesburg (Gauteng province) are among the most studied dust sources in South Africa due to systematic monitoring efforts and immediate impact on nearby urban air quality. However, few studies have drawn attention to dust originating from South Africa's extensive farmland. These areas appear to be most productive in early summer at the onset of the rainy season as part of cold pool outflows from convective storms over the Free State and Northern Cape. Such ground level events have often been reported by the media, but have gone unmonitored due to their association with cloud and rain events. These associations are different from most other dust events that produce elongated plumes during the clear winter months, particularly in Namibia and Botswana, and disperse throughout the region. Nevertheless, the use of Meteosat MSG clearly suggests that southern African events are not infrequent and not insignificant in extent. Exposed agricultural lands are thus important dust sources in South Africa, and the supply of fine dust material may be even more pronounced during drought cycles. Such events represent a loss of soil mass at the site of origin, but also impact ecosystem services further afield and, potentially, contribute to climate change. Microbial and chemical contaminants transported by dust from cropland add to the public health concerns with dust originating from farms and reaching urban areas. The research questions of this four-year project thus are: (i) what are the environmental thresholds for generation of dust (wind, soil moisture soil crust) in relation to farmland management? and, (ii) to what extent do farmland dust sources impact ecosystem services, public health, and potentially climate? This research aims to fill this knowledge gap by using a holistic and interdisciplinary approach spanning geomorphology, land management, and microbiomics. A Swiss - South African partnership of four institutions (University of Basel, Agricultural Research Council, University of Cape Town, and University of Pretoria), which encompasses the necessary expertise, has been formed to conduct this research. The objectives of the project are (i) to identify the spatial and temporal pattern of dust emissions from agricultural land in South Africa, (ii) to determine the environmental boundary conditions for dust emission on South African cropland identified as dust sources, (iii) to identify the impact of land management practices on dust emission and ecosystem services losses, (iv) to identify microbiomics air contamination due to dust, and (iv) to synthetize the above information and produce holistic knowledge on dispersal, impact of dust and thresholds to inform policy in farming systems. Activities and methods will be divided in five interconnected work packages (one WP per objective), using remote sensing of Meteosat and MODIS satellite imagery to identify and quantify dust sources emitted from farmland (WP1), using a rain and wind tunnel simulator to determine crust formation and dust physical boundaries (WP2), using leaf area index and interviews to identify biophysical and management attributes (WP3), using dust samples to determine microbial population phytogenetics, including impacts of the transport of microorganisms, whether suspended in aqueous aerosols or adsorbed to mineral (dust) particles (WP4), and using  the results of WP1-4 for a synthesis leading to publish holistic scientific contributions on South African cropland dust emissions, identify farmland management best practices, and inform policy. Dust emission is a growing issue affecting soil mass losses, ecosystem services, public health, and climate change. Understanding dust emission dynamics originating from farming in drylands is crucial not only to prepare and respond to the aforementioned impacts, but also to secure food production in the best possible conditions using marginal lands, a resource becoming increasingly important for food security of a warming planet.",NA,external_funding,Active,3700208,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,134,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE
"Marsano, Anna",NA,Departement Biomedizin / Cardiac Surgery and Engineering (Marsano),Engineered patches for cardiac repair,2017,"Background. Revascularization strategies are the current standard clinical procedure for chronic myocardialischemia which otherwise, if not treated, leads to progressive deterioration of cardiac function and eventually to endstageheart failure. Nevertheless, some patients might benefit from an adjuvant angiogenic therapy supporting thegrowth of new blood vessels in the ischemic tissue by delivery of pro-angiogenic factors (e.g. vascular endothelialgrowth factor, VEGF). However, uncontrolled microenvironmental VEGF expression has been shown to cause thegrowth of aberrant angioma-like vascular tumors. Therefore, we developed a FACS-based technique to rapidly purifytransduced adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASC) that homogeneously express specific and safe VEGF levels from aheterogeneous primary population.Rationale. Controlled VEGF delivery by direct intra-myocardial injection of retrovirally transduced and FACSpurifiedASC induced robust growth of normal and stable vessels both in normal and ischemic myocardium, andreliably avoided the growth of aberrant angioma-like structures. In the rat ischemic model only controlled VEGFexpression caused a moderate functional improvement. However, survival of the injected progenitors was very limited,in agreement with reported results in the literature. The limited cell engraftment might explain the moderate success ofcell injection-based clinical studies. To overcome this limitation we engineered a cardiac 3D patch, generated by cocultureof neonatal cardiomyocytes and this time skeletal myoblasts expressing a controlled VEGF level. We observed arobust and normal angiogenesis in the engineered graft, which supported the implanted cell survival and differentiation.Surprisingly, angiogenesis was also greatly improved in the underlying myocardium, where VEGF-expressing cellswere not present. Cardiac contractility was also significantly improved in a mouse infarction model. These results showthat a patch loaded with genetically engineered progenitors not only lead to a high cell survival upon implantation butalso has the potential to deliver controlled VEGF levels to the underlying ischemic myocardium and induce therapeuticvascular growth. We propose in this grant application to develop a cell-based controlled VEGF release system in orderto induce a normal and an efficient angiogenesis within the patch itself and in the surrounding cardiac tissue.Specific aims. This proposal covers three specific aims: 1. Obtain the proof of principle that VEGF-expressingASC can reliably induce normal angiogenesis inside and around the engineered patch (Aim1a) and then determine theminimum amount of engineered cells necessary to ensure the intrinsic angiogenic potential of the patch (Aim1b).2. Investigate the role of fresh stromal vascular fraction (SVF) derived cells, as source of endothelial progenitors andpericytic origin cells, in the patch vascularization dynamics and in the stabilization of the vascular networks when coculturedwith ASC expressing either specific (Aim2a) or heterogeneous (Aim2b) VEGF levels. 3. Test the efficacy andsafety of the engineered cell-loaded patch as a controlled VEGF-releasing device to treat cardiac ischemia in rats(Aim3).Experimental design. FACS purified populations of retrovirally-transduced ASC expressing either heterogeneousor specific rat VEGF164 levels will be loaded on a collagen based scaffold by using bioreactor-based culture system. Coculturewith SVF will be used to accelerate the in vivo patch vascularization. First, we will use an ectopic rat model toscreen out the most promising patch composition to induce normal angiogenesis within the patch and in the surroundingtissue. Then, the intrinsic angiogenic potential of the selected engineered patch will be tested in a cardiac ischemic ratmodel assessing cardiac functionality.Expected value of the proposed project. The proposed project is expected to provide a basic proof-of-principle touse a cell-based angiogenic factor release system for promoting vascularization in the surrounding tissue. Theoptimization process will be pursued in order to minimize the quantity of transduced ASC needed and to open up a coculturewith SVF. Furthermore, the proposed research will also provide insights of the angiogenic dynamics in vivo andwill elucidate the role of SVF in the vascularization process.",NA,external_funding,Active,3775402,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,135,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"Grzesiek, Stephan",NA,Departement Biozentrum / Structural Biology (Grzesiek),"Biomacromolecular structures, dynamics and interactions by NMR and new developments in NMR technology",2017,"Biological function results from time-dependent interactions between biomolecules. NMR spectroscopy is the only experimental method, which yields both structural and dynamical information on biomolecules at atomic resolution with minimal invasiveness and at close to natural conditions. As such it can provide unique information to understand the connection between structure, dynamics and function. It is the goal of this proposal to apply and further develop these strengths of NMR technology in two subprojects. Subproject A is directed towards the determination of structure, dynamics, and interactions in several medically important systems, for which we have made significant progress in recent years: (1) two G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), i.e. the beta1-adrenergic receptor (b1AR) and the chemokine receptor CCR5, which is also the coreceptor for HIV. For b1AR, we could show that it is possible to follow signal transduction by 1H-15N backbone resonances. We now want to carry out a full NMR dynamics characterization comprising the binding of drug, G protein and arrestin ligands in different membrane environments. Beside solution NMR, this will also entail the study in full lipid bilayers by solid state NMR. Thus we hope to establish b1AR as a reference system for studies of GPCRs by NMR. We have recently obtained solution spectra for CCR5 of comparable quality to b1AR. We could also detect many resonances of the engineered chemokine ligand 5P12-RANTES in complex with CCR5 by solid state NMR. 5P12-RANTES is currently in clinical trials as an HIV entry inhibitor. We want to carry out a solution and solid state NMR analysis of this receptor with 5P12-RANTES and engineered RANTES ligands that elicit different arrestin and G-protein signaling activities with the aim to provide the structural and dynamical explanation for this differing signaling behavior. (2) Interactions of the bacterial virulence factor cyclic di-guanosine-monophosphate (c-di-GMP). We have solved the structures of several c-di-GMP protein complexes and c-di-GMP oligomers as well as determined the kinetics of c-di-GMP oligomer formation in solution. In particular, we could recently solve the structure of the c-di-GMP recognition region of the chemotactic protein CleD in complex with c-di-GMP. C-di-GMP binding to CleD induces formation of a ternary complex with the flagellar motor switch protein FliM thereby controlling bacterial flagellar motor function. We now want to solve the structure of the full c-di-GMP-CleD complex and study the formation of the ternary c-di-GMP-CleD-FliM complex. (3) Abl kinase, which is an important leukemia drug target. We have shown that binding of different classes of inhibitors to a large, multidomain Abl construct induces distinct domain rearrangements, which shed light on the mechanism of kinase regulation. We have now assessed the influence of a number of medically relevant point mutations and studied a larger class of inhibitors. In particular, the opening of the multidomain structure is correlated to the conformation of the activation loop in the catalytic domain. We now want to obtain an in-depth dynamic description of the catalytic domain, which is possible due to an advance in labeling techniques, as well as continue to develop suitable labeling of Abl for single molecule FRET studies. Subproject B is directed towards NMR technique development. Often proteins from higher eukaryotes cannot be expressed in functional form in E. coli, but only in higher eukaryotic expression systems. The difficulties of isotope labeling in such systems presents a bottleneck for the analysis by modern heteronuclear NMR. We have recently developed a robust method for isotope labeling in insect cells by feeding isotope-labeled yeast extract. The method currently yields 90 % 15N and 13C as well as &gt;60 % 2H labeling with very good yields. We want to improve this method by increasing the level of 2H incorporation and cost efficiency for 13C labeling as well as extend it to other eukaryotic systems. We also want to obtain an in-depth understanding of the often adverse effects of 2H incorporation to cellular behavior by a proteomics analysis of the response to growth on 2H2O for E. coli, yeast and higher eukaryotes.","Biophysics, Structural Biology, GPCR, kinase, NMR, FRET",external_funding,Active,3775406,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,136,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

By exploring the quotidian interactions of the supposed collaborators; between the structures and hierarchies of colonial and post-colonial states on one hand, and the broad sections of the colonial African society, on the other, I seek to understand how African police navigated and negotiated their lives and work vis-a-vis the particular ambiguities of decolonisation in a settler context. Consequently, I conceptualise African police as political actors whose personal motivations as well as their outlook on law and authority and visions of the nation-state have contributed to the formation of the nation-state in Zimbabwe.  By placing African police at the centre of analysis, this study seeks to argue that this group of subjects shaped the process of decolonisation and the post-independence recasting of the nation-state in more complex and multifarious ways than existing research acknowledges. Broadly, examining Zimbabwe's violent and drawn-out decolonisation process through the lens of African police intermediaries contributes to historiography on colonial policing and everyday life in former settler colonial states. Trapped in the polarised binaries of collaboration and resistance, existing historical studies on the matter, whether written from the stand-point of empire or as institutional histories, have been preoccupied with the coercive nature of policing as central to controlling colonial societies and maintain the authority of alien rule. Neither of these perspectives left much room for systematically studying the socio-political histories of agents like police during the crises of decolonisation in Africa beyond common-place stereotypes. Secondly, by extending into the post-independence era, it not only makes critical empirical contributions to literature on intermediaries in the late colonial years but also stretches the category to new frontiers. More specifically, the approach complicates several narratives in the historiography of African nationalism and decolonisation. Firstly, it allows us to re-think the binaries of collaboration and resistance, as well as domination. This can show the complex agency of state bureaucracies and their clients in the context of the colonial retreat and the making of the nation-state. This multiplicity of choice and action, I argue, is essential to understanding the micro-processes of decolonisation in former settler colonial state. In particular, I aim to demonstrate how individuals on the ground viewed emancipation, and the subtleties, ambiguities and ambivalences produced by the heterogeneity of thought and action. Interpreting decolonisation thus moves away from interpretations of liberation struggles that emphasize the bifurcation of winners and losers. Instead, we attain a nuanced analysis which draws out the multiplicity of stakes and shifting loyalties in a spectrum of political possibilities. Lastly, the study provides a useful foundation from which to comprehend both the complexities of law enforcement and the dynamics of history and memory in contemporary Zimbabwe and African politics. The study will use material from various archival collections in UK, South Africa and Harare. In addition, oral interviews with retired African police and their immediate families will be used extensively in order to corroborate archival material.

"Trendelenburg, Marten",NA,Departement Biomedizin / Clinical Immunology (Trendelenburg),Complement-dependent pathogenic mechanisms in systemic autoimmunity,2017,"Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is the archetype of an autoimmune disease and can involve any organ system eventually leading to comorbidities that can also be observed independently of underlying SLE. The complex pathogenic mechanisms leading to and being involved in this autoimmune-inflammatory syndrome are not well understood. However, complement C1q, the first component of the classical pathway, seems to play a central role. By analysing the role of C1q as well as it's interaction with autoantibodies targeting C1q (anti-C1q) in SLE, the primary goals of the proposed projects are to elucidate 1) mechanisms being involved in the initiation of autoimmunity, 2) mechanisms of secondary acceleration of inflammation, and 3) processes being associated with comorbidities.With regard to mechanisms being involved in the initiation of SLE, homozygous C1q deficiency is the strongest genetic risk factor for the development of SLE. Vice versa, in SLE patients without primary C1q deficiency, C1q is consumed during disease flares, deposited in affected tissues and becoming a target of autoantibodies (anti-C1q). By the characterisation of structures targeted by anti-C1q we aim to understand mechanisms leading to the development of SLE.Secondly, C1q mediates and modulates the uptake of apoptotic cells, a mechanism that is defective in SLE patients. In the context of a defective clearance, dying cells can become antigenic and trigger the autoimmune response. In previous studies I could show that anti-C1q specifically recognize C1q when being bound to apoptotic cells and that anti-C1q induce a proinflammatory phenotype in macrophages being associated with reduced phagocytic capacity. To explore mechanisms of secondary inflammation, I will further investigate how C1q and anti-C1q interact with other mediators of inflammation.Thirdly, our previous analyses of bone marrow-derived human anti-C1q identified sequence homologies with von Willebrand Factor (vWF). In analogy to anti-C1q, vWF also binds to C1q leading to consecutive platelet rolling and adhesion, thus establishing a novel link between C1q and primary hemostasis. The focus of the third part of our project is to elucidate this link, in particular with regard to comorbidities as observed in SLE. Taken together, the proposed projects will elucidate the role of complement C1q and anti-C1q in interaction with other mediators of inflammation and factors that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of SLE. These data will also improve the understanding of immune-mediated pathology occurring related to but independently of autoimmunity.",NA,external_funding,Active,3816452,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,139,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Numerous bacterial pathogens targeting eukaryotic host cells have adopted these supramolecular protein assemblies for the intracellular delivery of bacterial effector proteins from the bacterial cytoplasm directly into the host cell cytoplasm. We are using zoonotic pathogens belonging to the closely related genus Bartonella (causing bartonellosis) and Brucella (causing brucellosis) to address fundamental questions related to the roles of T4S systems and their effector proteins in the establishment of chronic bacterial infection.Over the past 16 years we have - with support from the SNSF (grants 61777, 109925, 132979, and 149886) - established Bartonella as a powerful model for studying the cellular, molecular and evolutionary basis of T4S in bacterial pathogenesis. In early studies we have shown that the VirB T4S system represents an essential virulence device that translocates a cocktail of Bartonella effector proteins (Beps) into mammalian host cells, which subverts multiple cellular functions that facilitate chronic infection. We have then functionally characterized the bipartite secretion signal of Beps composed of a C-terminal BID domain and a charged tail. In recent years, we have assigned physiological functions to several Beps, identified some of their host cellular targets and performed corresponding structure-function analysis. We have also shown that all Beps are derived from a single ancestral effector that resulted from the fusion of a FIC domain derived from a bacterial toxin-antitoxin system that mediates AMPylation of target proteins and a BID domain derived from the secreted substrate (relaxase) of a conjugation system. We have further shown that independent Bep arsenals evolved in parallel in three Bartonella sublineages by gene duplication and diversification events, eventually resulting in Bep arsenals that facilitated adaptation of the host-restricted bartonellae to novel mammalian hosts. In the frame of the proposed project (subproject A), we want to deepen our understanding of the molecular functions of representatives of the growing repertoire of Beps by identifying their host targets and performing molecular and structure-function analysis. A major goal will be to understand the functional versatility of the limited set of Bep effector domains - FIC, BID and phosphorylated tyrosine arrays - to subvert a wide spectrum of host functions. Moreover, we want to characterize the physiological functions of representative Beps during infection using cell culture and animal infection models, with a focus of understanding how they facilitate evasion of innate immune responses by the pathogen and support bacterial spreading from the dermal infection site towards the replicative niches in deep tissues and blood.The Brucella project - funded by SNSF grants 132979 and 149886 - was initiated six years ago as a new research line. We are studying the role of the T4S system and its effectors in trafficking of the Brucella containing vacuole (BCV) and the establishment of an intracellular replication niche in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We have shown that the T4S system-dependent escape of the early BCV from the degradative endocytic network and its trafficking towards the ER depends on retrograde endosome-to-Golgi trafficking pathways. Moreover, using yeast as surrogate model we have been able to map the wiring of T4S effectors to conserved eukaryotic signaling and trafficking pathways and we identified candidates of some of their mammalian target proteins by yeast two-hybrid screens. In the frame of the proposed project (subproject B) we intend to (i) refine our understanding of the T4S-dependent intracellular trafficking route of the BCV towards the replicative niche in the ER and (ii) study the molecular functions of individual T4S effectors in this process. Due to the small size of the biosafety 3 (BSL3) laboratory presently used by us at the nearby Swiss TPH Institute this project will remain a rather small activity and limited to cell culture infection models until 2018 when we will move into the new Biozentrum building with its state-of-the-art BSL3 facility that will allow us to significantly expand our activities in this project, including animal experimentation.",bacterial pathogenesis; immune response; type IV secretion ; bacterial effector protein; chronic infection; Bartonella; Brucella; animal infection model; Stat3,external_funding,Active,4237871,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,140,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Antiviral therapy is only accessible to a minority of those in need, and preventive vaccines for HCV and HIV remain unavailable. Neonatal exposure to HBV accounts for a majority of the 240 million HBV carriers and typically results in antiviral tolerance. Unlike for CD8 T cells, however, the mechanisms governing antibody responsiveness to neonatal infection remain poorly defined. Vectored immunoglobulin gene delivery (VIGD) represents an innovative approach to circumvent immune exhaustion and tolerance in the treatment of persistent viral diseases. Whether VIGD can help restoring the host's endogenous immune response, to complement the antiviral effects of VIGD and resolve chronic infection, remains yet to be investigated.Working hypothesis: I) Humoral tolerance to congenital viral infection is incomplete, both at the level of B cells and antiviral CD4 T cells. Some non-classical T cells and/or T follicular helper cells provide help to antiviral B cells upon escape from central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms. The resulting antibody response exerts constant selection pressure on the persisting virus. II) The antiviral efficacy of VIGD relies to a significant extent on its synergy with the host's cellular and humoral immune defense mechanisms. These are augmented and functionally restored upon VIGD.Experimental models and methods: We will exploit reverse genetic techniques for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in conjunction with innovative gene-targeted mouse models. Antiviral immune defense, immune exhaustion and tolerance will be investigated in the context of persistent infection and its treatment by VIGD.

This has strongly influenced both our business and our private life and has brought forward a large variety of monitoring applications in different domains. In all these applications, the analysis of data streams in real-time is essential. One of the main challenges in data stream analysis is the detection of complex events out of the raw streaming data. While personal assistants allow to analyze in detail the activities of individuals, the analysis of entire teams, in particular complex events reflecting the interaction and relations between team members on the basis of the data streams captured on the individuals is largely unexplored. At the same time, such team analysis is essential in all applications where groups of individuals have to jointly solve complex tasks. Examples can be found, for instance, in team sports or in rescue operations (fire fighting, disaster management, etc.). The goal of StreamTeam is to monitor, analyze, and visualize the actions of teams of individuals in real-time in highly dynamic and mobile environments in a robust and scalable way. StreamTeam meets the challenges arising from the very rapidly increasing volumes of continuous data streams that will be digitally captured on the individual and goes beyond mere data collection about sensed facts and log-based post-hoc analysis of the actions of individuals. Most importantly, StreamTeam takes a major step towards online inference of group behavior. StreamTeam will provide i.) novel algorithms for the detection of semantic events in streams of data coming from highly mobile sensors, ii.) a scalable platform for the management of data streams and the detection of semantic events in real-time, and iii.) several ways to specify and retrieve complex events and high-level strategies, including innovative graphical query interfaces, both online/real-time and offline/post-hoc, thereby bridging the gap between a generic platform and selected complex events in a concrete application. The StreamTeam project will focus on team sports, and in particular on football, based on an existing collaboration between the DBIS group at UNIBAS and the BFH Centre for Technologies in Sports and Medicine. As the Swiss Federal Institute of Sport Magglingen (SFISM) is part of the BFH centre (co-applicant Martin Rumo has a double affiliation at both institutions), the latter acts as interface between technology and especially computer science and sports. The BFH centre closely collaborates with the Swiss Football Association (SFV) and in particular with the coaches of the youth national teams of the SFV. In addition, the BFH centre has also a close collaboration with the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). As this community is currently in the process of preparing the basis for deploying sensors in the equipment of the individual players, ice hockey will be considered as a second use case for the evaluation of the project results as soon as these technical developments further proceed.",NA,external_funding,Completed,3827676,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,144,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"Betz, Matthias",NA,Bereich Medizinische Fächer (Klinik) / Endokrinologie / Diabetologie,Influence of glucocorticoids on human brown adipose tissue and cold induced thermogenesis,2017,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is unique in its capability to convert chemical energy directly into heat. It is crucial to the survival of newborn infants and small mammals exposed to cold. The recent discovery of active BAT in human adults revealed exciting new aspects of human energy metabolism. Active BAT increases energy expenditure and can thereby counteract obesity and insulin resistance. BAT could thus serve as a potential therapeutic target to treat obesity and its associated diseases. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are frequently used in clinical therapy to suppress immune response in auto-immune, inflammatory and pulmonary diseases. However, their long-term use is associated with weight gain and insulin resistance. While the effects on GCs on glucose metabolism are quite well studied, data on energy expenditure in humans is scarce. Moreover, in vitro and animal data point towards an inhibiting effect of GCs on BAT function and development. This has hitherto not been investigated in humans.The aim of this project is to study both the acute and long-term effect of GCs on human BAT and cold induced thermogenesis (CIT) using a translational and multidisciplinary approach employing state-of-the-art imaging and molecular analysis. The project will be divided into three sub-projects: 1) The first projects aims to investigate the acute effect of one week of high-dose glucocorticoids on human BAT function and cold induced thermogenesis in an investigator-blinded, cross-over trial in healthy volunteers. Techniques used will comprise measurement of cold induced thermogenesis (CIT) by indirect calorimetry, functional and anatomic MRI, as well as molecular analysis of muscle and adipose tissue biopsies.2) The second project is designed as an observational study in patients requiring high-dose glucocorticoids for six weeks. It will comprise measurement of CIT, measurement of glucose uptake into cold stimulated BAT by 18F-FDG-PET/CT and measurement of novel biomarkers of BAT function.3) The third project will investigate the prevalence of retroperitoneal BAT in patients undergoing surgery for benign adrenal tumors and its relation to glucocorticoid secretion. We will analyze the tissue using real-time-PCR, Western-blotting and immunohistochemistry for classical markers of BAT and for recently described transcription factors that have been shown in rodents to be influenced by GC exposure.Together, these projects will allow us to develop a comprehensive overview of the consequences of GC excess on BAT and CIT.",temperature regulation; glucocorticoid excess; insulin resistance; glucocorticoid; Cushing's syndrome; brown adipose tissue; obesity; energy expenditure; diabetes; thermogenesis,external_funding,Completed,3606628,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,145,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Specialized high throughput sensor devices can be used in controlled lab environments that provide very large data collections. These collections can be analysed to come up with new findings by verifying or falsifying concrete hypotheses. However, the majority of scientific domains is more complex and cannot rely on such rather simple data gathering and processing pipelines: first, the phenomena to be monitored in the real world are complex in their spatial and temporal dynamic, and confounding factors are typically of multi-causal origin. Thus, the phenomena can-not be isolated nor can natural environments be rebuilt in controlled lab environments, which was one of the lessons learned from the Biosphere II programme. Monitoring in the field is essential, but it can hardly be done with conventional sensor technology only at landscape scale, since there are always technical trade-offs between spatial resolution, coverage, temporal resolution and in-terpretability. Furthermore, even if resolution and coverage of sensors is satisfactory, it is not obvious where and when to deploy these high precision/throughput sensors to capture relevant phenomena. In the weObserve project, we will rely on citizen observers to provide semantically rich information directly from the field to complement and enrich existing sensor data. In addition, monitoring data from citizen observers will be used to anticipate where interesting phenomena are supposed to take place, to use societal knowledge and judgement on relevance of phenomena and to deploy high resolution sensing devices in these areas. From a technical point of view, weObserve will address the collection, integration, and processing of heterogeneous data in applica-tions which cannot rely on off-the-shelf sensing devices for moni-monitoring purposes. Heterogeneity includes the volume of data provided via different channels, the precision, the coverage in time and location, and also the predictability. Data collection will there-fore seamlessly combine several types of data sources: (i) high throughput sensing devices which produce very large volumes of data and cover large areas, but with rather low resolution, (ii) Citizen Observers which provide semantically rich data, but with varying levels of precision and substantial sampling bias, and (iii) specific high resolution sensing devices that need to be manually deployed. Data integration will deal with such heterogeneous data. For subsequent analysis, the origin (provenance) and uncer-tainty of individual data items needs to be kept in an integrated data set. Data analysis will detect hidden patterns and the main explanatory factors in data collections. Integration of domain knowledge into the analysis process will be essential for detecting sampling biases and confound-ing factors. Specific emphasis needs to be put on analysis models that can deal with multiple data queues varying in size, reliability, representation and resolution. A further important aspect con-cerns visualization of detected patterns as a means for improving communication between those using the data for scientific purposes and those collecting it.

Integration (Weder); Europainstitut / Europäische Wirtschaft (Weder),Endogenous Creation and Dissolution of Economic and Monetary Unions: An Experimental Investigation,2017,"After a period of enlargement and strengthening of political and economic integration, European countries are experiencing difficulties in sustaining cooperation in the long-run. The European Union (EU) faces considerable centrifugal forces following discussions about a Greek exit from the European Monetary Union (EMU) in the Summer 2015 and, after the vote to exit the EU in the Summer 2016, the submitted letter of resignment of Britain in Spring 2017. Two questions naturally arise. What determines the stability of economic and monetary unions, such as for example the E(M)U? And what institutions can facilitate cohesion as well as long-run cooperation in heterogeneous groups?This proposed scientific project studies long-run cooperation in heterogeneous groups, using laboratory experiments. The focus is on the endogenous formation and dissolution of groups by means of either voluntary exit or group exclusion, when players interact as strangers over an indefinite horizon. The experiment can provide valuable intuition on the dynamics of creation, stability and dissolution of economic unions.From an international economics perspective, individuals have different incentives to become part of, remain in or leave some form of economic or political union, depending on the circumstances of the country in which they are living. From the trade literature, for example, we know that the gains from trade tend to be larger for individuals in a small country compared to those living in a large country, due to the larger change in relative prices of goods and services. From the literature on monetary integration, we would, for example, expect individuals in countries with ""bad"" monetary policies to be more interested in a monetary union than those living in a country with ""good"" monetary policies.Economic theory may provide us with a good understanding of how rational individuals in different countries will support economic unions within well defined, solid institutions. As emphasized by Buchanan and Brennan (1985, p.1), ""the rules that coordinate the actions of individuals are important."" As these rules are, however, endogenous and may be weak or even unobservable in reality, experiments represent a useful methodological approach to study endogenous creation and dissolution of economic and monetary unions. The project will collect data on individual behavior under different circumstances. In this manner, the project aims to identify causal links between underlying institutional and economic factors and outcomes in terms of the creation, stability and dissolution of prototypical economic unions.This research will contribute to multiple fields, from experimental to monetary economics, from international economics to the study of cooperation, pushing forward the idea of using laboratory experimentation to investigate real-world issues in trade and in international economics (Noussair et al., 1995, 1997).",NA,external_funding,Completed,3774024,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,147,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Current therapies for diseases of hepatocytes are limited and in most cases only treat symptoms. Therefore, improved therapeutic technologies are needed. Nanomedicines for the delivery of therapeutic genes have the potential to overcome the lack of satisfactory and alternative treatment options. This grant application focuses on the design of functional nanomedicines for targeted nucleic acid delivery (i.e. plasmid DNA) to liver parenchymal cells. The proposed project consists of three work-packages, which can be summarized as follows:First, specific and highly selective targeting of hepatocytes will be achieved using a targeting ligand derived from hepatitis B virus (HBV). This HBV entry inhibitor ""Myrcludex B"" consists of a lipid-conjugated polypeptide (i.e. the PreS1 domain of the large surface glycoprotein of HBV) and is characterized by a strong tropism for hepatocytes. Optimized Myrcludex B-derived lipopeptides will be conjugated to the surface of pegylated liposomes to mediate hepatocyte specific drug delivery. Second, in order to optimize loading and retention of DNA expression plasmids within lipid nanoparticles, a novel library of double tailed, ionizable amino-lipids will be created and screened for efficient and safe transfection activity. The combination of this new class of amino-lipids with a novel nanoparticle formulation technique (i.e. microfluidics) offers the possibility to optimize the transfection efficiency of the lipid-based delivery system. Third, in the final part of the project, both technologies will be combined to achieve targeted gene delivery to human hepatocytes; both in vitro in human liver derived cell lines as well as in vivo in different mouse models expressing the mouse or human NTCP, i.e. the entry point for HBV and at the same time our highly selective target structure on hepatocytes. With our novel targeting strategy, we have the possibility to address an unmet medical need. Non-viral gene delivery may offer well tolerated therapeutic options for diseases of the liver such as Crigler-Najjar syndrome, where a single gene defect leads to severe clinical manifestations. The proposed project will be the first step towards a future therapeutic intervention for this and other orphan liver diseases.",liver; gene delivery; nanomaterials; drug targeting; disease; hepatocyte; liposomes,external_funding,Completed,3775400,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,148,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"Salameh, Najat",NA,Departement Biomedical Engineering / Adaptable MRI Technology (Salameh),Interventional and susceptibility artifact-free MR Imaging,2017,"Medical imaging techniques have radically transformed the landscape of modern diagnosis and therapy by giving full access to the internal structure and function of the body. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), in particular, enables high-resolution imaging of the human body with unmatched soft-tissue contrast in a completely non-invasive and non-ionizing manner. Unfortunately, clinical MRI scanners operate at very high magnetic fields (1.5 T, 3 T) that increase their intrinsic sensitivity but also sensitize them to magnetic material in general, thus precluding their use for a wide range of applications. In patients with implanted devices or iron overload, MRI is typically contraindicated and ionizing Computed Tomography (CT) or invasive biopsies can help, but do not suffice for accurate diagnosis or repetitive examinations as treatment follow-up. For interventional medicine, the interest in MRI monitoring is increasing but has difficulty to develop due to the many challenges posed by the presence of powerful magnets and radio frequency equipment inside an operating room. By design, MRI high-field magnets are not flexible and provide very little space for surgeons, and custom-designed, non-magnetic and non-electrically conductive equipment is mandatory to protect patients and staff from undesirable accidents. Furthermore, the compliance with non-magnetic environments is needed to ensure that scans are free from undesired image artifacts and severe signal losses. Typically found at interfaces (e.g. at air-tissue interfaces, in iron-overloaded tissues, or around implanted devices), magnetic susceptibility differences cause nuclear spins to lose coherence in magnetic field gradients and can result in image distortions, ghosting artifacts and dramatic signal losses.Operating at low magnetic fields, however, allows being much less sensitive and even immune to magnetic susceptibility changes, offers great flexibility for the design of open geometry scanners, and thus provides the ground for new applications not requiring a completely non-magnetic environment. In recent work, I have investigated new approaches that mitigate the substantial loss in sensitivity inherent to the low field regime, and showed the feasibility of high performance imaging. Low magnetic fields would permit MRI in the presence of iron or implanted devices, which is critical in the fields of iron-overloaded organs (like hemochromatosis) and image-guided therapies.",Low magnetic field MRI; Implanted devices; Iron overload; MR sequence development; MR hardware development; Interventional MRI; MR Elastography; MR-guided therapies; MRI; Magnetic susceptibility,external_funding,Active,3768385,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,149,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"Schuldt, Heiko",NA,Departement Mathematik und Informatik / Datenbanken (Schuldt),Polypheny-DB: Cost- and Workload-aware Adaptive Data Management,2017,"In the last few years, it has become obvious that the ""one-size-fits-all"" paradigm, according to which database systems have been designed for several decades, has come to an end. The reason is that in the very broad spectrum of applications, ranging from business over science to the private life of individuals, demands are more and more heterogeneous. As a consequence, the data to be considered significantly differs in many ways, for example from immutable data to data that is frequently updated; from highly structured data to unstructured data; from applications that need precise data to applications that are fine with approximate and/or outdated results; from applications which demand always consistent data to applications that are fine with lower levels of consistency. Even worse, many applications feature heterogeneous data and/or workloads, i.e., they intrinsically come with data (sub-collections) with different requirements for data storage, access, consistency, etc. that have to be dealt with in the same system.This development can either be coped with a large zoo of specialized systems (for each subset of data with different properties), or by a new type of flexible database system that automatically adapts to the -potentially dynamically changing- needs and characteristics of applications. Such behaviour is especially important in the Cloud where several applications need to be hosted on a shared infrastructure, in order to make economic use of the available resources. In addition, the infrastructure costs that incur in a Cloud are made transparent in a very fine-grained way. The Polypheny-DB project will address these challenges by dynamically optimizing the data management layer, by taking into account the resources needed and an estimation of the expected workload of applications. The core will be a comprehensive cost model that seamlessly addresses these criteria and that will be used, in two subprojects, to optimize i.) data storage and access, and ii.) data distribution. Each of the two subprojects will be addressed by one PhD student.Data Storage and Access: different physical storage media such as spinning discs, flash storage, or main memory come with different properties and performance guarantees for data access, but also significantly differ in terms of the costs for the necessary hardware and the volume of data that can be managed at a certain price. In addition, the access characteristics of applications (e.g., read-only, mostly reads, balanced read/write ratio, high update frequencies) may favour one solution over the other or  even require hybrid solutions. The same also applies to the data model to be used and the choice between structured data, semi-structured data, or schema-less data management. Similarly, applications might require data to be approximated to speed up queries or to be compressed to save storage space. In Polypheny-DB, we will jointly address  these choices  and  alternatives  by  devising  a  comprehensive cost model for data storage that allows to decide, if necessary at the level of sub-collections, how they can be best stored given an available budget and the requirements for data access. The costs for data storage and access will be continuously monitored, together with an analysis of the expected workload of applications and their storage strategy will be updated dynamically, if necessary.Data Distribution: a high degree of data availability necessitates that data is replicated across different sites in a distributed system. For read-only applications, this also allows to balance the (read) load across sites. However, in the presence of updates, additional costs for distributed transactions incur to make replicas consistent - unless weaker consistency models can be tolerated. In our previous work, we have designed, implemented, and evaluated a protocol that manages data in a distributed environment either by dynamically replicating data and managing consistency based on the costs that incur and the available budget or by partitioning data, in particular by co-locating data items that are frequently accessed jointly to minimize the number of distributed transactions. While both approaches are very effective, none of them alone can address dynamic workloads. In Polypheny-DB, we will develop a comprehensive cost model that seamlessly combines replication and partitioning of (subsets of) data. Again, the cost model will be used to dynamically re-assess replication and/or partitioning decisions and to adapt data distribution from a cost-effectiveness point of view.","Cloud data management, Data Partitioning, Data replication, Data storage, Dynamic adaptation",external_funding,Active,3775394,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,150,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

T lymphocytes and their innate counterparts, the innate lymphoid cell (ILCs) are tightly regulated by a coordinate program of transcription factors. Moreover, tissue microenvironments contribute to the outcome of local immune responses such that immunopathology is avoided. Group 3 ILC3s are abundant in Ag entry sites like intestine, secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) and are also found in postnatally developing tertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs). They act as first-line responders to tissue injury, infection and inflammation. Small intestinal (SI) ILC3s prevent T cell responses to commensal Ags, whereas splenic (SP) ILC3s promote T cell responses to foreign Ags emphasizing their tissue-specific properties. How SP and SI ILC subsets and T cells collaborate during inflammation and infection is not understood. A detailed analysis of SP and SI ILC subsets under homeostatic and inflammatory conditions will help to understand the mutual interaction of lymphoid tissues, ILC3s and T cells that are required for immune homeostasis in tissues. Here we propose a system-wide approach to investigate transcriptional landscapes of SP and SI-specific ILC3 subsets in mice under homeostatic and inflammatory conditions and in mice with disturbed T cell compartments. In particular, we seek to identify transcripts in ILC3s, which are tissue-specific or depend on interactions with CD4+ T cells. Moreover, we want to identify key pathways in ILC3s, which regulate their immune-regulatory function for CD4+ T cells. Finally, we want to elucidate how TLOs modulate adaptive immune responses. Working hypothesis: This research project is based on the hypothesis that the collaboration of ILC3 subsets with CD4+ T cells differentially regulates innate inflammation and adaptive immune responses in a tissue-dependent manner.Specific Aims: Here we propose a novel project aimed at (1) dissecting the molecular signatures of ILC3s, (2) characterizing the mutual interactions of ILC3s and CD4+ T cells and their impact for innate and adaptive immunity in vivo and (3) generating an inducible IL-7 tg mouse to test the effect of TLOs on ILC3s and adaptive immune cells.Experimental Design and Methods: Advances in single cell analysis, gene targeting and generation of inducible mouse models together with state of the art bioinformatics will be used to address the specific aims. We will map ILC3 signature in SP and SI of normal and CD4+ T cell deficient mice and in mouse model with acute intestinal or splenic inflammation. The function of tissue-specific ILC3 genes will be tested in loss of function models using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated deletion in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and by generating ROR?Cre-lox recombination mouse models. Using various Ags we will test the capacity of ILC3 subsets to regulate T cell responses in vivo and in vitro. Finally will study whether the induction of TLOs by ILC3s has an impact on adaptive immune cell homeostasis. Expected Value of the proposed project: Data obtained from this study will help to identify target genes and pathways that control the induction or suppression of T cell responses.

By comparison, alternative reimbursement schemes, involving flat rates per patient or for complex treatments provide a financial incentive to avoid overtreatment. This is the background against which the reimbursement schemes for primary care physicians and paediatricians were reformed in Switzerland and Germany. The aim of the study is to investigate how the reforms of the reimbursement schemes remuneration systems in Switzerland and Baden-Württemberg are affecting medical out-patient services and health care costs. The purpose of reforming the Swiss system is to create financial incentives for moving provision of care away from specialists to primary care physicians. This study will undertake a quasi-experiment that will use routine data to compare the services provided before and after implementation of the reform of the traditional remuneration system. Paediatricians in Baden-Württemberg have the option of choosing between two different reimbursement schemes. They differ with regard to the services for which a flat rate is paid. Routine data will be used to examine how the alternative schemes affect the provision of services. And finally, the results obtained for Switzerland and Baden-Württemberg will be compared. The study will provide information on how future reimbursement schemes can be designed to avoid overtreatment and curb rising healthcare costs more effectively.     ",Physician reimbursement,external_funding,Completed,3696409,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,157,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"Widmer, Andreas F.-X.",NA,Bereich Medizinische Fächer (Klinik) / Infektiologie (Battegay M),Chlorhexidine vs PVP iodine in alcohol for disinfection of the surgical site: a cluster-randomized multicenter trial Investigator initiated clinical trials (IICT),2017,"Surgical site infections (SSIs) are the most common nosocomial infections in surgical patients causing significant increases in morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. As they are usually caused by components of the normal skin flora disinfection of the surgical site with an antiseptic skin preparation is standard practice prior to any surgical intervention. To date, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) did not define any compound. However, the new WHO guideline favors chlorhexidine (CHX)-containing compounds based on two randomized controlled clinical trials (WHO-guideline, Lancet Infectious Diseases, in press 2017). The CDC recommends 2% CHX-based preparations for cleaning the insertion-site of vascular catheters. As compared with PVP-iodine (PI) CHX in alcoholic solution reduces catheter-related infections by roughly 50% suggesting that CHX solutions may also be superior to PI in preoperative skin antisepsis. The available evidence from 12 RCTs shows that for preoperative skin antisepsis alcoholic antiseptic solutions are more effective then aqueous ones in reducing SSI (OR 0.60; 95% CI: 0.45 - 0.78). Moreover, the available evidence from 5 RCTs shows that alcoholic PI is neither beneficial nor harmful in reducing SSI rate as compared to alcoholic CHX (OR 0.60; 95% CI: 0.25 - 1.46). A landmark paper by Darouiche (NEJM 2010) demonstrated disinfection with alcoholic CHX to be superior to PI to prepare the surgical site. However, whether the alcoholic compound or CHX was responsible for the improved outcome remained unclear. In 2016 Tuuli published data on superiority of alcoholic CHX to alcoholic PI in cesarean section. However, the SSI-rate was higher than in a very large observational study from our institution even if the same definitions and follow-up procedures were applied.The number of applications of disinfectants required for preoperative skin antisepsis is as of yet unresolved. The current practice of 3 applications is not based on sufficient evidence from large randomized clinical trials. Unpublished data from the University Hospital of Basel show that in approximately 10% of patients an adequate reduction of microbial counts on the incision site can only be achieved by 3 as compared to 2 paints.Therefore, a randomized controlled clinical trial is needed comparing the effect of CHX and PI in alcoholic solutions and after decades of use, the best disinfection compound will have been evaluated.Swissnoso - the association of Swiss infection control specialists - provides services for ANQ (Nationaler Verein für Qualitätsentwicklung in Spitälern und Kliniken) in terms of measuring incidence of SSIs on a large scale. Currently, more than 250'000 patients have been included to assess the rate of SSIs stratified by type of surgery and underlying diseases. A pilot study has started in 2015 to standardize preoperative measures to prevent SSIs, measures that are lacking in more than 50% of hospitals. The university hospitals of Basel, Zurich and Berne as participating centers in the trial included altogether 3'420 patients in cardiothoracic and abdominal surgery in the aforementioned SSI-surveillance in 2104 and will therefore be able to provide the necessary case numbers.We will conduct a cluster-randomized multi-center trial. Outcome variable is SSIs, and non-inferiority defined as nonsignificant difference in the rate of SSIs among patients undergoing the similar procedure with &gt;500 patients in each strata with a power of 90%. Sample size calculations - based on the meta-analysis to be published by WHO and the Darouiche study will ask for 500 patients in each group. We will include &gt;1000 patients in 2 strata: abdominal surgery and cardiothoracic surgery, summing up to &gt; 2000 patients. The departments of surgery of the study sites will be randomized to use alcoholic CHX or alcoholic PVP iodine during a fixed time period, and after e.g. one month, switched over to the other product. Data will be collected by a case-report form. Data on SSI will be assessed by the Swissnoso surveillance system. A standard operating procedure for disinfection of the surgical site will be developed as there is NO national standard. A working group will be established to coordinate local principle investigators to monitor progress of the study, and guarantee compliance with the protocol.In addition, microbial swabs prior to and after each paint of the skin antisepsis will be taken in 250 patients in each stratum to measure relative reduction of bacterial counts on the insertion site.

Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) are particular problems in many parts of the world including South Africa. Yet, little is known on the bacterial factors driving the global epidemics of MDR/XDR-TB. In the past, de novo acquisition of drug resistance determinants during patient treatment was considered the main driver of drug resistance in TB because the fitness costs associated with resistance were thought to make drug-resistant bacteria less transmissible. However, recent experimental and epidemiological data show that the fitness of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is heterogeneous and that a large proportion of MDR-TB is in fact transmitted. Preventing ongoing transmission of drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) is fundamental to controlling the epidemic. Understanding the interplay between drivers of de novo emergence and transmission of DR-TB, and the impact of treatment is key to developing new treatment regimens and ultimately improving control strategies.Aim, Hypotheses and ObjectivesWe aim to use next-generation whole genome sequencing (WGS) to study the evolution and epidemiology of DR-TB in Khayelitsha, a high HIV, TB and DR-TB burden setting in South Africa. We have access to a detailed patient-level clinical database, maintained as part of an ongoing community-based DR-TB treatment programme initiated in Khayelitsha in 2008. We propose to link these data to a biobank of stored Mtb strains held at Stellenbosch University to test the following Hypotheses:1.The transmission success of drug-resistant Mtb varies as a function of the specific combination of drug resistance-conferring mutations, compensatory mutations and strain genetic background;2.The transmission success of drug-resistant Mtb further depends on the HIV status of the host;3.The within-host evolution of Mtb populations (incl. resistance acquisition) differs in HIV-coinfected and HIV-negative TB patients;4.The within-host evolution of Mtb populations also depends on the efficacy of the treatment regimen administered.We will test these hypotheses by addressing the following objectives:Primary objectives:1.Use WGS to assess drug resistance evolution and transmission of DR-TB over time (10-years from 2008-2017) and in relation to level of drug resistance, HIV status and geographical location.2.Assess 'within-patient' Mtb evolution among drug-resistant strains during treatment of individual patients, focusing on resistance acquisition for existing and new TB drugs, and contrasting HIV-negative and HIV-infected individuals.3.To enhance capacity for bacterial population genomic analyses and genomic epidemiology in South Africa.Secondary objectives include:1.To assess the utility of WGS for rapid determination of drug resistance profiles and the potential for use of this data to inform individualisation of treatment. 2.To assess innate resistance to new and repurposed anti-TB drugs.MethodsThe study will be both retrospective, using clinical data and stored Mtb isolates from 2008-2015 and prospective, utilising data from the Khayelitsha programme from 2016-2017. Mtb isolates will be sub-cultured and bacterial DNA extracted in South Africa and sent to Switzerland for WGS. Data analyses will be performed in close collaboration between the teams in South Africa and Switzerland; regular visits in both directions will support these exchanges. WGS will be conducted on an estimated 1,900 isolates from patients across the 10 years of the Khayelitsha cohort, using the Illumina technology. Sequence reads will be analysed using the bioinformatics pipeline developed at the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH) and concurrently with the bioinformatics pipeline utilised by Stellenbosch University (SUN). Phylogenomic and population genomic methods will be used to study the bacterial population structure and diversity of Mtb isolates across and within individual patients. To assess bacterial fitness in terms of between-patient transmissibility, we will collaborate with ETH Zurich to apply phylodynamic models to the sequence data. A sub-sample of patient isolates will be selected to undergo quantitative phenotypic drug susceptibility testing to a range of key first-line and second-line anti-TB drugs. This will include the new drugs bedaquiline and delamanid, and the repurposed drug linezolid. This data will be used to assess phenotype/genotype relationships for existing, new and repurposed drugs, in addition to assessing the utility of using WGS-derived resistance profiles to individualise second-line treatment.

"van den Anker, Johannes","Heininger, Ulrich; Bielicki, Julia",Bereich Kinder- und Jugendheilkunde (Klinik) / Pädiatrische Pharmakologie (van den Anker),A randomised controlled trial of adjunct corticosteroid therapy in hospitalised children with community acquired pneumonia (CAP): THE KIDS-STEP STUDY Investigator initiated clinical trials (IICT),2017,"Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common reason for hospitalisation in childhood and represents a considerable socioeconomic burden. In hospitalised adults with CAP, we have shown a beneficial effect of short-term steroid treatment on time to clinical stability and on duration of hospital stay in a randomised controlled trial (RCT). These benefits in adults with CAP have been confirmed in a recent meta-analysis and appear to be independent of the aetiology of CAP. It is unclear if adjunct steroid treatment benefits children with CAP.Rationale: An intervention that shortens time to stability and discharge in childhood CAP would carry substantial socioeconomic benefits in terms of healthcare resource utilization as well as parental and child absenteeism from work and out-of-home activities, respectively. Based on our findings in adult patients with CAP, we expect a positive clinical effect of steroids also in children. So far, no large-scale RCTs have evaluated the effectiveness of oral steroids on patient-relevant or clinically relevant endpoints in childhood CAP. In particular, it is unclear whether clinical improvement in the short-term is offset by a mid-term increase in CAP recurrence. Aim of the study: The overall aim of the trial is to evaluate the impact of oral steroid treatment in children with CAP on outcomes that are of high importance for patients. Specifically, we aim to concurrently assess the effect of adjunct oral steroids in children hospitalised for CAP on clinical stability (efficacy) and CAP recurrence (safety).Objectives: The primary objective is to concurrently evaluate (i) whether treatment of children hospitalised for CAP with oral betamethasone is superior to placebo for clinical stability (defined as resolution of vital sign abnormalities in room air) within 48 hours of hospitalization; (ii) whether treatment of children hospitalised for CAP with oral betamethasone is noninferior to placebo for CAP-related readmissions to hospital within 28 days of randomisation. Other objectives include the evaluation of effects of oral betamethasone treatment (versus placebo) in children hospitalised for CAP on: duration of hospital stay; severity and duration of CAP symptoms; parental absence from work and/or child absence from routine out-of-home care or school; overall duration of antibiotic exposure and inpatient days; intensive care unit admissions; mortality; rate and severity of solicited clinical side effects and serious adverse events. Exploratory subgroup analyses are planned to evaluate the effect of age, initial antibiotic treatment, respiratory pathogen detected in initial nasopharyngeal swab and radiological evidence of CAP. Study Design: We propose a pragmatic randomised, controlled, patient-, care-giver-, investigator- and outcome-assessor blinded multicentre trial in 8 Swiss paediatric departments with two parallel groups (one active, one control; 1:1 ratio). Preschool and school-age children with moderate to severe CAP (defined clinically) requiring admission to hospital will be included. 700 patients will be randomised 1:1 to receive betamethasone (Betnesol®) (active group: 0.2 mg/kg/d in 1 daily dose for 2 days; control group: 2 days of placebo). The co-primary endpoints will be (i) the proportion of children who are clinically stable within 48 hours of randomisation; the proportion of children requiring CAP-related readmission to hospital within 28 days of randomisation. Significance: Any treatment associated with an increased likelihood of early clinical stability may lead to a higher proportion of children suitable for prompt discharge, in turn reducing the patient-relevant outcome of length of stay. This would likely lead to changes in paediatric CAP management in Switzerland (and similar high-income settings), especially if recurrence of moderate-severe CAP remained demonstrably low.",NA,external_funding,Active,3848722,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,161,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Solar-fuels is a collective term for chemical energy sources created by harnessing solar-energy. Solar-fuels can be used to store the energy in a chemical form and regain it by a chemical process, such as oxidation, as in classical combustion processes. The concept of solar-fuels is quite intuitive in approaching the question on energy storage from the energy density point of view. The highest known energy mass densities can be found in nuclear fission and nuclear decay followed by chemical energy, which exhibits a 10-100 times higher energy mass density then electrochemical energy sources, such as batteries. In nature, photosynthesis is one of the key photochemical reactions for life, although the overall efficiency is low. Since 2007, solar-fuels have raised increasing interest in the scientific community, thus resulting in a tremendous increase of publications, with a particular emphasis on artificial photosynthetic systems. Main focus of this PhD project will be water splitting to create H2 from water as a solar-fuel: this process yields the maximum energy density for a chemical fuel. In particular, it requires two electrons, while for other solar-fuels like methane or ethanol, multiple electrons per mole of target are required, thus significantly reducing the efficiency of the photo-synthesis process. It is therefore reasonable to focus on the water-splitting approach. In the Constable-Housecroft Group, significant know-how has been developed on the synthesis of catalysts for water-splitting [1]. This PhD project will build on the existing background and aim to develop functional demonstrator devices to prove and assess the overall concept. For the two electron process, it is important to have an overlap in time of two excited electrons that can contribute to the reaction. Recent publications have been based on proton-coupled electron transfer [2,3]. The PhD student will study this latter approach on the efficiency increase that can be achieved using optical plasmonic nano-structures. Several limitations to the efficiency of the water-splitting are known [4]. One is a low absorption of many semiconductors due to a large and/or not overlapping bandgaps. Others are reflection due to a high refractive index of the semiconductor material and recombination due to a short minority carrier distance. The challenges are similar to those observed in organic (OPV) and Si (Si-PV) photovoltaics, two fields, where CSEM is particularly active through its PV Center. Plasmonic enhancement of the conversion efficiency have been studied for both PV systems. Water-splitting can benefit from this existing know-how: plasmonic structures and/or nanoparticles may lead to a significant enhancement of the conversion efficiency. Plasmonic nanoparticles are already reported in literature as giving significant enhancement to the conversion efficiency. Very similar to the enhancement mechanism in OPV, the nanoparticles act like antennas receiving the light and transferring the plasmon energy to a nearby absorber. Plasmonic nano-structures in the range of approx. 100 - 200 nm can address similarly the known limitations by injecting hot electrons and holes into the semiconductor [4,5]. Furthermore, nano-structures can be used to increase the effective optical path of photons propagating through photochemical active materials in order to increase the probability of absorption, and thus the overall efficiency. In contrast to the enhancement obtained using plasmonic nanoparticles [6], to the best of our knowledge, both the theoretical and the experimental proof-of-concept of large scale optical plasmonic nano-structures for enhanced water splitting have to not been investigated so far. Plasmonic nano-structures yield the potential for cost effective       and high reproducibility production of large areas, which will be a key for competitiveness of the described technology.   CSEM Muttenz has a strong background in both refractive and diffractive micro- and nanooptics, as well as in optical plasmonic nano-structures. Design and simulation tools and large-area manufacturing processes are available in-house, which can be used to create well-controlled plasmonic nano-structures and to replicate them on large surfaces. Due to its activities in OPV, CSEM Muttenz is fully equipped with solar simulators and has a strong background in light-management for photovoltaics.

These range from practical solutions to engineering problems to cosmic structure formation and evolution. In that respect, numerical simulations of fluids in astrophysics and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) are among the most computationally demanding calculations in terms of sustained floating point operations per second (FLOP/s). It is expected that they will benefit greatly from the future Exascale computing infrastructures, that will perform 1018 FLOP/s. This type of scenarios pushes the computational astrophysics and CFD fields well into sustained Exascale computing. Nowadays, they can only be tackled by either reducing the scale, the resolution and/or the dimensionality of the problem, or using approximated versions of the physics involved. How this affects the outcome of the simulations, and therefore our knowledge on the problem, is still not well understood. The simulation codes used in numerical astrophysics and CFD (hydrocodes, hereafter) are numerous and varied. Most of them rely on a hydrodynamics solver that calculates the evolution of the system to be studied along with all the coupled physics. Among these hydrodynamics solvers, the Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) technique is a purely Lagrangian method, with no subjacent mesh, where the fluid can freely move in a practically boundless domain, this being very convenient for astrophysics and CFD simulations. SPH codes are very important in astrophysics because they couple naturally with the fastest and most efficient gravity solvers such as tree-code and fast multiple methods. Nevertheless, the parallelization of SPH codes is not straightforward due to its boundless nature and the lack of a structured grid, causing continuously changing interactions between fluid elements or between fluid elements and mechanical structures, from one time-step to the next. This, indeed, poses an additional layer of complexity in parallelizing SPH codes, yet it also renders them a very attractive and challenging application for the computer science community in view of its parallelization and scalability challenges for the upcoming Exascale computing systems. We aim in this project to have a scalable and fault tolerant SPH kernel, developed into a mini/proxy co-design application.

The intention is to make proposals for merging existing data from the out-patient and in-patient settings and from the insurance sector. When medical services are used and invoiced, the process generates data that are important for steering the health service. The value of these data, however, is limited: firstly because there are major gaps in the data, especially as regards the out-patient setting; secondly because many data are held in isolation; and thirdly because many of the data are not available for research purposes. This means that there is insufficient data to provide a basis for decisions on developing the health system. The aim of the study is to create the conditions for improving the data situation in the Swiss health service. Factors that hinder or promote data harmonisation will be identified and policy makers will be made aware of the issue. A literature analysis and successful national examples will be used to identify the factors that determine the success of data merging, and the requirements that a harmonised database needs to fulfil will be established. In addition, roughly 20 interviews will be conducted with international experts in order to find out how other countries approach data harmonisation. A Delphi survey will also be used to identify the factors that hinder or promote data harmonisation in Switzerland.

Infections by so-called Gram-negative antibiotic-resistant bacteria are difficult to treat because these bacteria are protected by two membranes. Yet there are points in the outer membrane that are open to attack by active substances. We are characterizing one of these points, the protein BamA. BamA controls the process of incorporating other proteins into the membrane. If BamA is knocked out, this is fatal for the bacterium. We are studying the function of BamA and the incorporation of proteins at the atomic level, using NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. This makes the interactions between BamA and other molecules visible. In this way we can gain a better understanding of the mechanisms and look for active substances that interrupt them. Resistant strains of Gram-negative bacteria against which all known antibiotics are ineffective occur with increasing frequency. There is an urgent need for new active substances to control them. The aim of our project is to understand the mechanisms that Gram-negative bacteria use to incorporate membrane proteins into their outer membrane.

One of the most promising strategies is to interface biomolecules (enzymes, proteins, DNA, biomimics) with synthetic assemblies that have a variety of architectures (micelles, vesicles, tubes, particles) in order to mimic natural structures and functions. Such bio-hybrid materials have the advantages of combining the activity and specificity of biomolecules with the stability and precise topology of a synthetic matrix, and thus underscore conventional systems in terms of efficacy and functionality. This project aims to develop functional protein-polymer assemblies, which will serve as new types of catalytic nanocompartments providing efficient and controlled reaction space for biomolecules by combining physical chemistry, nanoscience and enzyme biochemistry. In a biomimetic approach inspired by natural organelles in living cells, we will encapsulate/insert biomolecules (proteins, enzymes) in synthetic nanocompartments to create catalytic reaction spaces with different topology and functionality. We will produce catalytic nanocompartments with ""triggered activity"" so that in situ reactions inside compartments are activated by opening ""protein gates"" inserted inside the membrane. A complementary objective is based on producing catalytic nanocompartments acting ""in tandem"" to support cascade reactions involving a combination of different nanocompartments. Catalytic nanocompartments, producing desired molecules ""on demand"" serve as simple mimics of natural organelles, whereas those acting ""in tandem"" mimic chemical communication between organelles. The development of enzymatic reactions in the confined spaces of supramolecular assemblies with nanometer sizes represents a response to the increasing evidence of low bioavailability and stability of directly administrated biopharmaceuticals, and the necessity to produce/detect compounds by controlled cascade reactions between different spatial assemblies in new materials with complex functionality (electronics, medicine, catalysis, food science). The understanding at the molecular level of the relationships between the factors that support successful reactions in confined spaces with different topologies represents a major benefit of this project, which aims to combine model enzymatic reactions with complementary properties resulting from different architectures of the reaction spaces (single-, and in tandem- nanocompartments) Systematic variation of the nanocompartment properties (size, thickness of the membrane, concentration of compartments), and characteristics of the biomolecules (concentration, modification with specific molecular entities, ratio between different biomolecules) will produce efficient interfacing and result in new functional hybrid assemblies. The project combines a fundamental study of the structural changes and interactions that occur when a functional bio-hybrid assembly is generated with applied investigations of the relevant factors and conditions that characterise ""model"" enzymatic reactions for extension to other reactions necessary for translational applications. This will support the development of a rational design for an efficient platform of catalytic nanocompartments by optimizing the structural and functional details for each type of reaction space (single-, and in tandem- nanocompartments), and straightforward changes of biomolecule or the overall polymer assembly.",Nano-compartiments polymériques; organelles artificielles; réactions en cascade; enzymes; protéines membranaires,external_funding,Active,3774059,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,172,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

While morphological information is mostly important in the longitudinal follow-up of a single patient, it is not an absolute marker of organ health. In order to obtain an absolute indication of muscle status, it is necessary to follow a functional approach, which would monitor the ability of the muscle to contract and to gather supplies of nutrients and oxygen from the blood. This approach can follow two paths: the first is the studying of the muscular kinematics using gated or real-time sequences during muscle movement; the second is metabolic assessment, which can either be measured directly (through 31P spectroscopy of muscle metabolites) or indirectly (for example by T2- or T2*-weighted imaging).In the last two years, our group has been developing a novel approach to acquire high-temporal-resolution images of the contraction of the skeletal muscle by inducing a reproducible movement by means of electrical muscle stimulation (EMS). With this method, contraction speed, strain, and strain rate were measured in a consistent and controlled way.This approach revealed itself promising for the purpose of observing the functionality of the muscles. However, so far it has been only developed for the study of kinematics, thus missing the metabolic information, and while further studies are ongoing, a clinical validation of the method is still needed. In addition, quantitative evaluation of the safety of the hardware setup connected to the subject has so far limited the acquisition to low-power sequences.Ideally, one would extend this approach to a more general ""toolbox"" consisting of methods that can give a broader view on the muscle functionality, coupling contractility and metabolism in the same kind of setup.In the first part of this project, we propose to continue the development of the synchronized imaging method, also by objectively evaluating its safety limits, and to extend it to spectroscopy, for which our group has access to the appropriate hardware, exploiting the same characteristics of repeatability and controllability of the electrical muscle stimulation. The velocity imaging sequence will be optimized by including the modern concept of simultaneous multislice imaging, in order to obtain volumetric coverage in reasonable scan time, and relaxometry methods currently used for the heart will be adapted to work in the muscle, in order to monitor changes in T1 and T2 during exercise.Once these steps are completed, we will focus on the development of interleaved imaging/spectroscopy methods, a concept which has been recently proposed, which would fuse the two main instruments of muscle functional imaging into a single acquisition.The second part of the project will be dedicated to the validation of the methods in a clinical setting on two different subject populations: on the one side, they will be used to objectively monitor the training of athletes (in collaboration with the Department of Sport, Exercise and Health (DSBG), Division Sports and Exercise Medicine of the University of Basel) and on the other side, they will be applied to the diagnosis and to the severity assessment of patients suffering from Becker muscular dystrophy (in collaboration with the Department of Neurology of the University Children's Hospital of Basel).In addition to the immediate scientific output, the outcome of this project will be a set of imaging and spectroscopy tools to be used in a clinical setting for the evaluation of the condition of muscles in different contexts, both pathological and physiological.

However, previous research has been fragmented, in particular in children and adolescents. As a consequence little is known about the relevance of exposure duration, noise characteristics and the effects in adolescents. Aims: The overall aim is to obtain a thorough understanding on how transportation noise affects human health. In particular, the following research questions will be addressed:1.From triggering events to chronic exposure effects: Which time scale is most relevant for cardiovascular mortality? Are cardiovascular risks reversible after noise exposure reduction?2.Role of noise characteristics for cardiovascular mortality: How relevant is eventfulness of noise and duration of quiet phases between events? How crucial is noise exposure at different times during day and night (diurnal variation)?3.Effects of noise exposure on adolescents' cognitive performance, behaviour and quality of life: How relevant is noise exposure at home vs. school? What is the role of sleep on health effects?Methods: Research will be based on the existing Swiss National Cohort (SNC) and adolescent HERMES cohort study. Nationwide models to predict road, railway and aircraft traffic noise and NO2 exposure at each address in Switzerland for 2001 and 2011 will be individually linked to study participants. For HERMES participants, a longitudinal analysis will be conducted to evaluate the effects of noise exposure at school and home on changes in cognitive function, behaviour and health related quality of life within one year of follow-up. Full residential history available after 2010 for the SNC will be used to elucidate the effects of a sudden change of exposure on cardiovascular mortality. A case-crossover analysis on the triggering effects of aircraft noise on acute coronary events will be conducted taking advantage of the daily distribution and variation of noise exposure, which is heavily influenced by meteorological conditions around Zürich airport.Significance: Rigorous scientific methods will be applied to address numerous novel and highly innovative aspects in noise research: i) case-crossover design for acute aircraft noise effects, ii) evaluation of sudden exposure changes due to moving residence or changing flight schemes, iii) focus on noise characteristics in addition to levels, iv) rigorous evaluation of mutual effects of noise and air pollution, v) estimation of indoor noise levels, vi) comprehensive appraisal of effects in adolescents. A better understanding of noise health effects can have far reaching impacts beyond Switzerland and Europe for both science and policy. Future research will profit from the new exposure assessment and analytical methods addressing long and short term exposure windows.

The annual influenza vaccine is the primary public-health intervention against these epidemics. The strains in the vaccine must be selected before the influenza season. Unfortunately, the selected strains sometimes fail to closely match those that end up actually circulating in the human population; such strain mismatches reduce vaccine efficacy. Methods for better selecting vaccine strains are therefore of paramount importance to public health.    We will use innovative new experimental and computational techniques to guide better vaccine-strain selection. Two key properties determine which influenza strains dominate a season: successful strains have high inherent fitness (manifested by a low load of deleterious mutations) and an abundance of antigenic mutations in the epitopes recognized by human immunity. We will measure how each of these properties is affected by every possible amino-acid mutation to the viral surface protein hemagglutinin. To make these high-throughput measurements, we will generate pools of viruses carrying all possible codon mutations to hemagglutinin, and then passage these mutant viruses in the presence and absence of human serum. We will then use ultra-accurate deep sequencing to count the frequency of every mutation pre- and post-selection, enabling us to quantify how each mutation affects both deleterious load and antigenic recognition by serum from a cross-section of the human population.   To improve vaccine-strain selection, we will use a real-time web platform to overlay our measurements of deleterious mutational load and the antigenic change onto an influenza phylogeny.

Among these investments, commodity-index related instruments are blamed as major drivers of prices and volatilities, which seem to covary more and more with the prices and volatilities of financial assets in recent times than with the ""real"" economic fundamentals.

The bulk of these third-wave democracies are clustered in post-communist Europe and Latin America. While in the founding elections of these democratizing states, participation rates were exceptionally high, in both clusters of third-wave democracies voter turnout has declined. The decline of voter turnout questions the democratic consolidation of these young democracies, as the linkage between the electorate and their representatives is potentially weakening and increasingly distorted. At the same time, voter turnout is considerably higher in the parliamentarian and presidential elections of Latin American countries compared to those of the post-communist area in Europe. Scholars have rarely addressed this gap in voter turnout in third-wave democracies from a cross-regional perspective, thus this puzzle has been largely neglected in scientific literature.This project addresses this puzzle by exploring voter turnout in third-wave democracies in Latin America and post-communist Europe. The project starts with a macro-level analysis of voter turnout in the first eight electoral cycles, relying on an eclectic theoretical approach allowing the detection of the factors that account for the decrease of voter turnout in third-wave democracies in post-communist Europe and Latin America, and explaining the variation in voter turnout across these two clusters. The second and the third part of the project analyses individuals' voting decisions by taking into account the role of the party system. The second and third part of the study tackles two prominent problems of young democracies: the legacy of their autocratic pasts and corruption. The second part of the project explores the differences between the voting decisions of the older generations who were politically socialized during the previous autocratic regime and the younger ones who have been socialized after the regime change. The third part of the project investigates whether individuals preoccupied with corruption decide to abstain or switch to new or oppositional parties that emphasize the need to combat corruption.

"Ciorba, Florina M.",NA,Departement Mathematik und Informatik / High Performance Computing (Ciorba),MLS: Multilevel Scheduling in Large Scale High Performance Computers,2017,"High performance computing systems are increasing in size (in terms of node and core count) and diversity (e.g., core types per node), leading to an increase in their available parallelism. Hardware parallelism can be found at several levels, from machine instructions to global compute sites. This results in several corresponding levels of software parallelism, from scalar instructions to global job queues. Unfortunately, exploiting the available hardware parallelism even at a single level is notoriously challenging, in part due to difficulty in exposing and expressing parallelism in the computational applications. Exposing, expressing, and exploiting parallelism is even more difficult when considering the increase in parallelism within each level and when considering more than a single or a couple of parallelism levels. Scheduling and load balancing are vital parts of any successful effort of coordinating and managing parallelism in high performance computing.  This project proposes to investigate and develop multilevel scheduling (MLS), a multilevel approach for achieving scalable scheduling in large scale high performance computing systems across the multiple levels of parallelism, with a focus on software parallelism. By integrating multiple levels of parallelism, MLS differs from hierarchical scheduling, traditionally employed to achieve scalability within a single level of parallelism. MLS is based on extending and bridging the most successful (batch, application, and thread) scheduling models beyond single or a couple of parallelism levels (scaling across) and beyond their current scale (scaling out).  The proposed MLS approach aims to leverage all available parallelism and address hardware heterogeneity in large scale high performance computers such that execution times are reduced, performance targets are achieved, and acceptable efficiency is maintained. The methodology for reaching the multilevel scheduling aims involves theoretical research studies, simulation, and experiments.  The expected outcome is an answer to the following research question: Given massive parallelism, at multiple levels, and of diverse forms and granularities, how can it be exposed, expressed, and exploited such that execution times are reduced, performance targets (e.g., robustness against perturbations) are achieved, and acceptable efficiency (e.g., tradeoff between maximizing parallelism and minimizing cost) is maintained? This proposal leverages the most efficient existing scheduling solutions to extend them beyond one or two levels, respectively, and to scale them out within single levels of parallelism. The proposal addresses four tightly coupled problems: scalable scheduling, adaptive and dynamic scheduling, heterogeneous scheduling, and bridging schedulers designed for competitive execution (e.g., batch and operating system schedulers) with those for cooperative execution (e.g., application level schedulers).  Overall, the project aims to make a fundamental advance toward simpler to use large scale high performance computing systems, with impacts not only in the computer science community but also in all computational science domains.",parallel and distributed computing; large scale computing; multilevel parallelism; concurrency and data locality; dynamic load balancing; scheduling and load balancing; single-level scheduling; high performance computing; multilevel scheduling,external_funding,Completed,3623894,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,180,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

In the same time span, total population is expected to grow from 8.3 million to 10.2 million while the potential workforce is growing from 4.8 million to 5.3 million. As a result, potential labour supply per capita is decreasing and at the same time the share of old-age dependants as well as the average age of the population are increasing rapidly. Among other problems, this is going to lead to significant distortions on labour markets; such as labour shortages or shifts in the structure of labour demand due to shifts in final goods demand. Furthermore, the current political climate in Switzerland tends towards restricting immigration. Since the Swiss economy already relies heavily on foreign workers, a restriction of immigration might aggravate the predicted labour supply shortages even further.The goal of this research project is to evaluate the consequences of population ageing for the Swiss labour market. A special focus lies on the labour demand side, specifically on medium and long term sectoral and occupational shifts caused by a decrease in (skilled) labour supply and a change in consumer demand structure due to the demographic change. Moreover, the general equilibrium effects of different policy reforms will be evaluated and compared. To achieve this goal we construct a dynamic overlapping generations (OLG) computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of Switzerland and calibrate it with current Swiss data. Models of this type are the conventional approach to evaluating inter- and intra-generational effects of population ageing. However, only few studies focus on the labour market and even fewer emphasise the demand side. The evidence is particularly scarce for Switzerland, where only a handful of general equilibrium analyses relating to population ageing have been conducted.In order to facilitate estimating realistic parameters of the model as well as calibrating the model to expected short and medium term industry-specific developments we plan to conduct a customised firm level survey, which, on its own, already constitutes a significant contribution to the relevant literature. The finalised model does not only allow us to predict transitional and long-term effects of the demographic change on the economy and the industry structure. It also provides us with the ability to evaluate and compare different reform proposals, such as an increase in the retirement age, reforms of the pension and healthcare systems and different immigration scenarios.

Indeed, contests are being employed to allocate various resources or positions, ranging from the award of promotions in companies to the distribution of scholarships among students at universities, or the allocation of research grants to researchers. Within the field of economics the study of contests has a long and successful history. The variety of contests observed in practice is also reflected in the theoretical analysis of these institutions. In a contest there is a number of contestants who compete against each other to win some prize. The details of how the contest is organized, however, play an important role in determining how many parties will want to participate and how much effort they will exert. While contestants typically know what prize they are competing for and how the winner is determined, they may be unaware of the exact number of competitors, their identity or their ability. The designer of a contest can take advantage of this uncertainty and try to better achieve their goal by strategically disclosing information about the environment to the contestants. The goal of this project is to study the role of information in contests and how the designer of a contest can harness this information to their advantage. More specifically, we are interested in competitors' information about each others' types. In order to study this problem, we plan to make use of the recently developed information design approach, also referred to as Bayesian persuasion. The idea is that in incomplete information environments incentives are determined by payoffs and beliefs. A mechanism designer tries to achieve some outcome by manipulating payoffs. In contrast, an information designer manipulates the agents' beliefs by strategically disclosing information about the environment. This research project focuses on the latter within the context of contests and is structured in three parts. First, we take a general approach to information design in static contests. Second, we allow for information transmission between contestants and study its effect on information design. Third, we move to a dynamic setting and study the information design problem over time.

"Gluth, Sebastian",NA,Departement Psychologie / Decision Neuroscience (Gluth),The influence of episodic memory on value-based decision making,2017,"Any decision we make is influenced by our memory (Weber and Johnson, 2006). From everyday purchases at the supermarket to live-changing decisions such as choosing a partner: we recall the positive and negative experiences from the past as a guide to our current preferences. Previous research on the interplay of memory and decision making has been focused on how reinforcement history shapes behavior (Schultz et al., 1997; Sutton and Barto, 1998) and on how rewards facilitate memory formation (Lisman and Grace, 2005; Wittmann et al., 2005). However, little is known about the neural and cognitive mechanisms that underlie the impact of remembering (and forgetting) particular events on making value-based decisions.  Recently, I addressed this question in a neuroimaging study by asking participants to choose between options that they had to retrieve from memory (Gluth et al., 2015). Combining cognitive modeling with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), I could show that people's preferences are biased by their memories, and that this bias is mediated by functional network interactions in the brain. The goal of this proposed research project is to extend this work for achieving a broadened and deepened understanding of the influence of episodic memory on value-based decision making. I will employ multiple neural and psychophysiological measurement tools (i.e., fMRI, electroencephalography (EEG), and eye-tracking), as well as mathematical modeling of memory and decision-making processes to develop a comprehensive picture of the neural and cognitive mechanism of memory-based preferential choice.  The project is divided into three parts. Subproject A addresses the question of how people are biased by their memory. I will examine two different, not mutually exclusive hypotheses for the origin of the memory bias: biased attention and uncertainty. In Subproject B, I will combine cognitive modeling of decisions and response times with the temporally precise EEG technology to investigate how the processes of memory retrieval and decision formation emerge over time. The goal of this subproject is to develop a unified cognitive model of memory-based preferential choice. Finally, I will utilize the insights gained from the first two parts for a comparison of memory-based decision making between younger and older people in Subproject C. The proposed research will advance our knowledge of the interactions between the neural systems that mediate remembering and deciding, and it will shed light on inter-individual differences in people's susceptibility to the memory bias on choice.",NA,external_funding,Completed,3775456,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,183,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

The project thereby focuses on green jobs and green skills and emphasises Switzerland's 'small open economy' characteristics.The main scientific innovation of this project is to investigate the Swiss labour market in terms of green jobs AND green skills in the context of a small open economy. Investigating jobs and skills required for the transformation towards a green economy should yield new insights regarding the readiness of the Swiss labour market to cope with a transition towards a green economy. Supplying the necessary qualifications will be a central challenge and also condition for success. Hence, deeper knowledge of potential mismatches between demand and supply may help to introduce appropriate measures that enable a successful transition path towards a green economy.The project is structured in three parts. In the first part, we analyse how stricter environmental regulations affect the relative demand for input factors. The main aim of this analysis is to understand the relative importance of labour as an input factor relative to other input factors, such as intermediate inputs or capital investments, in a green economy. With regard to green jobs and skills, we will study (a) to what extent the shift towards a green economy leads to an increased demand for jobs and skills, which are, based on existing studies, commonly labelled as green jobs and skills and (b) whether we can identify an increased demand for new jobs and skills, which are currently not labelled as green jobs and skills. If we find an increased demand for such jobs and skills, we will include them in our final list of green jobs and skills.In the second part, we analyse whether the Swiss labour force can provide the green jobs and skills that are required for the green transformation and/or whether the Swiss education system (private, public) is prepared to provide these skills in the near future. To achieve this, we will (a) quantify and characterise the demand and supply for green jobs and skills, respectively, and bring together demand and supply in order to identify evidence for possible skills shortages and mismatches, (b) focus on migration as a way to acquire the needed skills to cope with a skills shortage or mismatch due to a transition to a green economy, and (c) differentiate the analysis by industry to learn about the relative demand of specific industries for jobs and skills. In the third part, we build on the results of the first two parts and identify possible deficits in green skills in Switzerland's work force and show under which circumstances this might be a major problem (e.g., in the tradeable sector) or only a minor problem (e.g., under certain requirements in the non-tradeable sector). Next, we put these results together and investigate the relationship between green skills and environmental outcomes in the light of several circumstances, such as migration or the relocation of production. Finally, we show how the supply of green skills has to be adapted in order to meet the future demand for these skills. We thereby show in which fields of education or training course changes need to be made, so that students and/or trainees can obtain the necessary (green) skills to carry out green jobs. The necessary changes in the selected curricula will be identified and analysed in detail. This part thus delivers key insights about which conditions have to be fulfilled for Switzerland's transition to a green economy so that its resource use reaches a sustainable level, a positive environmental impact can be achieved and the Swiss economy is not overburdened.",NA,external_funding,Completed,3889618,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,185,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

In wastewater treatment plants it may permit operation under energy autarky and with a better carbon footprint. However, its process control and engineering is still under development: An optimized removal process using nitritation-anammox systems must combine stable operation, high N removal efficiency and minimized greenhouse gas emissions. Yet the biogeochemical and microbiological controls on the production of N2O in wastewater treatment are poorly understood. Similarly, the links between system stability, activity, and microbial population shifts are not well constrained. Equally important, in natural aquatic environments, the anammox process probably plays a much greater role than it was assumed for decades, challenging the traditional perception of the natural N-cycle. The questions regarding the prime pathways of fixed N loss in natural environments (i.e., denitrification versus anammox), the controls on the balance between fixed N loss and N2O production, and the associated microbial population dynamics are important rationales of current research. In this applied and environmental context, an important focus of the project will be on the use of stable isotope measurements and microbiological analyses to understand and identify N metabolism in pure and mixed anammox cultures, to assess the controls on N2O production in nitritation-anammox systems, and to verify ties between microbial dynamics, N-turnover and optimal process control.  The collaborative and highly interdisciplinary project ""IsoMol"", led by M. Lehmann (Unibas), seeks to understand the functioning of mixed microbial populations featuring alternative biogeochemical pathways and to characterize its dependence on environmental conditions and microbial composition. Each subproject will provide important information to improve our understanding of anammox on multiple levels (process engineering, isotope dynamics, microbiology). Subproject 1, led by A. Joss (EAWAG) has a strong applied component, which includes the set-up of enriched and mixed culture nitritation-anammox reactors at the laboratory and pilot scales. It aims at understanding both process controls and N2O emission in these systems (e.g., oxygen supply and temperature), and to evaluate the benefits of anammox-based wastewater treatment with respect to conventional approaches. Sub-projects 2 and 3, each with completely different analytical approaches, will develop and test stable isotope methods to understand and fingerprint N metabolism in pure and mixed cultures. Ammonium, nitrite and nitrate N and oxygen (O) isotope fractionation will be studied by M. Lehmann (Unibas), with a particular focus on the isotopic effect of anaerobic nitrate formation by anammox, as well as the potential of N and O isotope measurements to diagnose chemical transformations and reaction rates for different inorganic N substrates in general. Gas phase isotopic composition studies, led by J. Mohn (Empa), will identify the main processes leading to the emission of N2O across the range of typical operating conditions - in particular, with respect to a possible new pathway associated with the anammox metabolism. Subproject 4, led by H. Bu&#776;rgmann (Eawag), will make use of cutting-edge techniques in microbiology and genetics, specifically metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, to understand the structure and function of mixed-culture anammox consortia in response to key external variables, and the mechanisms that control stability. It will apply concepts of ecological stability to the anammox process, aiming for fundamental advances in our understanding of what drives resistance and resilience of the involved microbial communities and processes.  Energy-neutral municipal wastewater treatment is feasible with autotrophic N removal, but requires an optimized process design and control based on fundamental understanding of bacterial behavior and interactions. N (and O) isotope measurements in different N-species hold a strong potential to discriminate between alternative biochemical pathways and quantify reaction rates, to assess process stability and to understand the conditions that are most conducive to the emission of N2O. Similarly, the engineered nature of the community provides a unique level of control over what is nonetheless a complex real-life microbial community, and results will be immediately applicable to develop improvements for process engineering. In addition, the proposed research will provide the first in-depth transcriptomic analysis of anammox enrichments, and will significantly deepen our understanding of the physiological and regulatory differences between anammox strains. Our research may also contribute to the discovery and understanding of new modes of N2O production directly or indirectly related to anammox...","anammox, nitritation, wastewater, stable isotopes, isotope fingerprinting, metagenomics, wastewater, N2O, nitrate",external_funding,Active,3698148,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,186,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

The global warming threats leave us no choice but to rely on the production of clean energy, where the solar energy will slowly become our most important source to produce electricity due to its abundance from the sun. The production of electricity must, however, be as cheap as possible to compete with the well-established production of electricity from fossil fuels, such as coal and natural gas. This requires implementation of inexpensive and environmentally friendly materials into solar cells. In this regard, organic materials offer the solution because they can be produced cheaply on a large scale. The problem with organic photovoltaic devices is, however, their low power conversion efficiency, which is a consequence of the short exciton-diffusion lengths and imbalanced charge transport in organic materials with lower mobility of electrons than that of holes. Simultaneously, the best performing electron-transporting materials in organic solar cells, namely, fullerenes, absorb visible light poorly, are hard to modify, and expensive to produce.In this research proposal, the synthesis and experimental investigation of shape-persistent macrocycles, covalent organic cages, and nanotubes with built-in molecular electron acceptors is described. The symmetric spatial arrangement of these molecules, and the control of the mutual distance and orientation of the acceptor units will allow to study the charge photogeneration and the subsequent transport of electrons in the materials incorporating them as a function of relatively few structural parameters. The unique shape of the proposed macrocycles will, in addition, allow to grow highly crystalline materials for charge transport in solution or on surfaces. In combination with the facile synthesis, tunable light absorption, electronic, and solid-state properties of these molecules, the macrocycles, cages, and nanotubes will, one day, allow for substituting the fullerenes to make efficient organic solar cells commercially available and competitive with other photovoltaic technologies.",time-resolved spectroscopy; molecular cages and molecular nanotubes; organic thin films; electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy; organic photovoltaic devices; covalent organic frameworks; organic synthesis; electron transport; crystal growth,external_funding,Active,3889253,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,188,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

With a growing number of patients are utilising the internet in relation to their health care, it is expected that PRWs will play an increasingly important role in selecting a new physician. PRWs are another sign of the growing digitalisation of the patient-health professional relationship and raise a number of important ethical and communication issues. One of the key goals of PRWs is toimprove patient welfare through influencing patient decision-making and driving quality improvement. A related goal of PRWs is to improve patient health literacy to encourage and therefore respect patient autonomy. While recent research has indicated that PRWs can influence patient decision-making and have an impact on quality improvement, the ability of PRWs to achieve these goals is somewhat dependent on PRWs having a sufficient number of ratings. PRWs also have the potential to possibly harm physician welfare through having insufficient number of ratings per physicians and causing psychological and financial harm to physicians.Physicians´ fear of receiving negative comments on PRWs can also have a direct impact of the patient-health professional relationship by leading physicians to try and prevent patients from posting negative reviews on PRWs and legally challenging negative reviews that are posted. While PRWs have existed in Switzerland since 2008, there has been limited research conducted on this issue and there exists a number of important research gaps that need to be addressed.

However, the unique ability of complement to swiftly recognize foreign surfaces may suddenly turn into a burden when we are exposed to biomaterials, drug delivery vehicles, and cell or solid organ transplants. Prevention of complement activation directly on such non-self surfaces via protective coating is therefore considered a promising strategy for avoiding inflammatory complications. This proposal aims to design small complement-modulatory entities as a platform technology to be employed either as a surface coating or as a ""molecular bridge"" that guides physiological complement regulators to tissue, cell or material surfaces facing adverse activation of host defense pathways. The central element of our efforts is the cyclic peptide 5C6, which binds to the major complement regulator in circulation (i.e., Factor H; FH) and recruits it to 5C6-coated surfaces. The first stage of our research plan is focused on elucidating a structure-activity relationship profile of 5C6 to improve binding affinity, stability, and functionalization efficacy. For optimal activity, 5C6 needs to be coated on or tethered to a cell or material surface.

In the new application period (BASEL IX Validation) we will enroll 2'000 additional patients.

It is broken down into three subprojects. Subproject A (responsible: Prof. Dr. Helmuth Trischler, Munich) analyses how conflicts between transport policies and alpine conservation were dealt with on the European level, in particular by the European Union and the Council of Europe. It examines the formation of concepts of ecology and nature preservation and their circulation between supranational institutions (like the EU), international NGOs (UN, IUCN) and nation states. A key point of interest is the Alpine Convention, a treaty between the eight alpine nations and the EU for the sustainable development of the Alps. The convention will also be used as a conceptual lense to better understand the role of techno-scientific experts in alpine conservation as a negotiation space of political, economic, environmental, socio-technical, and societal factors. Subproject B and C focus on regional and national authorities as well as the regional and transnational networks of the alpine conservation movement. Geographically, Subproject B (responsible: Prof. Dr. Patrick Kupper, Innsbruck) deals with the case of Austria and addresses the disputes over alpine transit across the Brenner Pass, against the backdrop of Austria's joining the EU in 1995. Subproject C (responsible: Prof. Dr. Martin Lengwiler, Basel) focuses on Switzerland and on debates about alpine transit over the Gotthard Pass, particularly in the context of the so-called ""Alpen-Initiative"", which imposed a restrictive transport policy framework and had a lasting impact on Swiss-EU relations. The three case studies offer the possibility to write a transnational history of environmental movements and open a new perspective on Europeanisation.

"von Lilienfeld, Anatole",NA,Departement Chemie / Physikalische Chemie (Lilienfeld),Sampling chemical space with alchemical perturbation theory,2017,"Much research is devoted to the study of the relationship between the properties of materials and their chemical composition and structure. Rigorously rooted in quantum mechanics (QM), statistical mechanics, and heavy computing, employed methods nowadays permit to routinely predict relevant properties for novel combinations of atomic configurations and composition, effectively sampling chemical compound space (CCS). The task of using QM for the discovery of novel compounds with improved properties is therefore equivalent to a combinatorial optimization problem in CCS. Albeit straight-forward, tackling this task through QM based high-throughput screening is the least efficient way. This proposal is about the advancement of methods which enable the exploration and sampling of CCS in dramatically more efficient ways, without loss of accuracy. In particular, we plan to use ``alchemical'' perturbation theory which leverages differential, response-like, QM calculations of reference molecules and materials. Results for these perturbation theoretical calculations can subsequently be usedto accurately estimate properties of thousands, if not millions, new molecules and materials ``close by'' in CCS with negligible, or constant, computational overhead. Building on recent contributions, we propose three sub projects: (1) to investigate alchemical second and higher order perturbations to afford potential energy estimates of molecules with unprecedented speed and accuracy. (2) to use alchemical estimates for the tailoring of electronic properties in novel materials (important for renewable energy applications),and (3) to make accurate alchemical estimates of chemical reaction energy profiles (important for improved reaction conditions or catalysts).",chemical space; density functional theory; perturbation theory; computational alchemy,external_funding,Active,3949396,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,198,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Long-term survival can currently be achieved in only ~60% of patients despite of intense multimodal treatment protocols; a disappointing figure stagnating since more than three decades. A partial explanation for treatment failure might lie in the number and kind of mutations in osteosarcoma genomes that vary significantly between individual tumours and of which only few are targetable. Despite the genetic complexity, we have recently shown that &gt;90% of osteosarcomas display mutation patterns similar to those seen in BRCA deficient breast and ovarian cancers (so-called BRCAness) rendering them likely susceptible to PARP inhibitor treatment.Since our findings captured BRCAness only in pre-therapeutic biopsies so far, the proposed project aims to follow its evolution over time using sequentially obtained material from 16 patients, including samples from the initial biopsy, the resection specimen as well as from recurrent disease. We shall integrate exome, genome and RNA sequencing supplemented by copy number and methylation analyses to explore the clonal diversity and hierarchy, thus building an evolutionary history of each tumour. Additionally, we shall assess the degree of BRCAness and therefore the likelihood of specific tumour cell populations to respond to PARP inhibition at different stages of the disease. An additional cohort of &gt;220 osteosarcoma samples, all derived from an international osteosarcoma treatment trial (EURAMOS1), and with complete clinico-pathological data, is available for validation of the main findings from cohort 1 and further (epi-)genetic studies. Together with collaborators from other countries that have also collected samples of EURAMOS1 patients, we aim to assemble the yet largest series of osteosarcomas and attempt to correlate (epi-)genetic findings with clinico-pathological data. Specifically, we shall validate the prevalence of BRCAness and search for complementary / alternative vulnerabilites.We believe that only the complete integration of genomic and epigenomic data may identify subtle functional signatures of mutational processes with prognostic or even therapeutic impact. Hence the proposed project will provide a deeper understanding of osteosarcoma evolution in a time-dependent manner.

Current results and clinical reports describe it as a promising method to facilitate rehabilitation in patients with acquired brain injury (ABI). However, there are very few studies investigating AAT in this patient group and there is little knowledge of possible mechanisms (Munoz Lasa et al., 2015). Objectives of the project: The proposed projects will examine the effects and clinical significance of animal-assisted therapy in patients with acquired brain injury (ABI) within different stages of function deficits in comparison to ""treatment as usual"".Methods: To investigate the effects and the effectiveness of animal-assisted interventions in patients with ABI, four randomized controlled trials will be conducted: a first study will explore long-term effects of AAT on 70 patients with acquired brain injury who have some brain function deficits but a full level of awareness in a randomized, controlled study. Outcomes are socioemotional functioning as well as therapy motivation and quality of life measured via behavioral coding in Noldus Observer and FPTM, VAS and WHOQOL-BREF (study 1). In patients with disorders of consciousness, we will investigate the effects of AAT on awareness and achieving therapeutic goals measured via behavioral coding in Noldus Observer, CRS-r, GCS and BAVESTA (30 patients, study 2) and underlying biological correlates such as frontal brain activity measured via NIRS, EDA, HR and HRV (30 patients, study 3). Both studies are designed as randomized, controlled trials. Study 4 serves as a comparison and uses the same design as study 3 but includes 30 non-clinical participants without any brain function deficits. Significance of the study: The proposed studies will help to evaluate the highly innovative and promising method of integrating animals within a therapeutic context for patients with acquired brain injury. The proposed studies will help to better understand mechanisms of animal-assisted therapy and contribute to the development of new treatment approaches. For patients with severe disorders of consciousness, in particular, there are currently limited treatment options, and animal-assisted therapy represents a new and promising approach. Therefore, it is imperative to understand how these patients can be reached individually to prevent risks of long-term, persistent harm.

They exhibit nanoscale dimensions and can be persistent due to topological protection. These nanoobjects have been first discovered at low temperatures in a small number of bulk single crystals of high purity and quality. Such chiral magnets are now of substantial interest for both fundamental condensed matter physics due to topological effects and applied sciences such as spintronics. The physics and manipulation of Skyrmions stabilized by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) are relatively well established in bulk materials at low temperatures. The results promise novel device concepts in magnetic storage and information technology offering low power consumption. Technologically relevant structures will necessarily involve nanostructures operated at room temperature. The research on nanosystems is however mostly at the theoretical and numerical level because the relevant materials pose key challenges in the synthesis and fabrication of strain-free thin films that support the Skyrmion phase. Despite strong efforts, Skyrmions at room temperature have been observed only very recently in metallic ultrathin films and the bulk metallic alloy CoZnMn. Corresponding semiconductors and insulators that will decisively enhance the technological impact remain to be discovered.In this proposal we aim to go beyond the state-of-the-art of existing Skyrmionic schemes in that we intend to:-Systematically search for novel metallic, semiconducting, and insulating materials hosting Skyrmions at high temperatures-Achieve strain-free thin films and free-standing nanostructures with volume-DMI for Skyrmion-based devices -Image and manipulate Skyrmions up to the microwave frequency regime and down to the single Skyrmion level to set the base for Nanoskyrmionics.These ambitious goals can be achieved only by intimately combining different disciplines at their highest level and from diverse areas of research.

In the mammalian hippocampus new neurons are continuously generated throughout life. The adult-born hippocampal granule cells are well known to improve learning and memory, by enhancing the brains capability to discriminate similar memory items. Disturbed adult neurogenesis may contribute to many pathophysiological conditions, including anxiety disorders and major depression. On a cellular level, distinct functional properties of the young neurons have been described, including enhanced excitability, reduced GABAergic inhibition and enhanced synaptic plasticity. However, so far, it is absolutely unclear how these cellular properties might contribute to hippocampal information processing on a network level to finally generate the behaviorally determined memory improvements. Specific Aims. In the new project, we will analyze population activity in young granule cells, to investigate how the new neurons might contribute to encoding and discrimination of different neuronal input patterns on a network level. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that sparse glutamatergic connectivity together with dynamically regulated GABAergic interneuron activity might tune sparse coding within the newborn young population. Therefore, we will systematically investigate synaptic activation of newborn granule cells at different time points after cell division in vitro and in vivo. Young neurons will be identified by different means including retrovirus-mediated birth dating and Mash1-CreERT-dependent tdTomato expression, which allows to label a cohort of newborn 2-, 3-, 4- or 8-week-old neurons. By making use of various optogenetic tools, we will first map synaptic responses of neighboring young neurons to cortical and subcortical afferent synaptic inputs using paired patch-clamp recordings in hippocampal brain slices from adult mice. Second, we will make use of Cre-dependent genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) to characterize population activity in response to different afferent spatio-temporal activity patterns. Third, we will characterize the contribution of different types of local GABAergic interneurons to the spiking activity of young granule cells. It will be of particular interest to study the potentially different excitatory and inhibitory effects of different interneuron subtypes onto young cells. Finally, we will establish in vivo calcium imaging with the new Inscopix nVoke endoscopic imaging system, which not only enables recording from GCaMP6-labeled young neurons in freely moving animals, but also allows for temporally controlled optogenetic silencing of young neurons. The animals will be exposed to different behavioral conditions including novel objects and environments. Young neurons will be recorded across subsequent recording sessions to finally see how their activity adapts during conditions of novelty learning and memory recall.

These ""hybrid"" systems of cold ions and atoms have formed the basis of exciting new avenues of research. These include studies of the dynamics of ion-neutral collisions at very low energies, the elucidation of exotic ultralow-temperature ion chemistry, the investigation of many-body physics in a regime of intermediate interaction strengths, precise characterizations of intermolecular interactions and the development of new cooling techniques for ions.One major drawback of previous experiments, however, was their technological restriction to laser- coolable atoms, mostly alkalis, which were confined in suitable atom traps and superimposed with trapped ions. This experimental limitation severely constrained the scope of systems and phenomena which could be studied. As the main objective of our current SNSF project over the past two years, we have been developing a new experimental approach for the simultaneous trapping of cold neutral molecules and molecular ions which substantially enhances the chemical and scientific scope of hybrid trapping experiments. Our new method is based on the magnetic trapping of Stark-decelerated cold neu- tral molecules which are superimposed with sympathetically cooled molecular ions in a radiofrequency ion trap under cryogenic conditions. This new experimental setup opens the dorr for probing interactions, collisions and chemical reactions between ions and molecules in the millikelvin regime for the first time.Following the experimental development of this new method during the first phase of the project, we now apply for a continuation of this project grant to harvest its full scientific potential by (i) implementing internal quantum-state preparation of both the trapped neutrals and the trapped ions in order to realize fully state-controlled studies, (ii) further extending its chemical scope by trapping a wider range of neutral molecules and molecular ions, and (iii) apply these developments to investigations of cold collisions and chemical reactions in a range of prototypical and fundamental ion-molecule hybrid systems consisting of the combination of N2+ , O2+ and H2O+ with OH and NH.The present project combines experimental methods established in the domains of quantum optics and atomic and molecular physics in a new and original fashion in order to address pertinent problems in chemistry and chemical physics.

The project addresses this gap by exploring practices and perceptions of violence, particularly everyday violence, in late nineteenth and early twentieth century southwestern Africa. Everyday violence unquestionably played a crucial role in the border region of southern Namibia and the northern Cape: Africans' day-to-day struggles with and resistance to violent colonial oppression, seizure of land and livestock as well as conscription into forced labour in the agrarian settler economy coincided with conflicts within and between African polities revolving around political power and influence, social status and economic wealth. The project explores how and in what ways practices of (everyday) violence such as shooting, flogging or beating and the meanings ascribed to them were (re)shaped in the border region between c. 1880 and 1910. African actors, especially Nama-Oorlam and Herero groups, are at the center of its focus. In order to gain insights into the different actor's habits of using violent practices and to discern possible shifts, the project seeks to closely describe everyday violent practices and to situate them in the historical context of African pastoralism, settler colonialism and colonial state-building. Adopting an entangled history perspective and drawing on frontier and borderland concepts, the project furthermore explores whether there were instances of mutual learning and adaptation between African, Afrikaner and European actors in the course of their (violent) encounters.The study will thus contribute to a growing body of scholarly literature in Africanist and European colonial historiography discussing shared practices of colonial violence and the role of mutual observation and knowledge transfers. The empirical analysis of everyday violent practices shifts the attention away from extreme violence, combat and warfare and de-centers previous approaches solely focusing on European colonial actors. Such a perspective yields new insights into the (trans)formation of social relations in southwestern Africa around the turn of the century and into the role of violence in settler colonialism more broadly. Furthermore, the project intervenes with questions on the character and dynamic of settler colonialism as well as on the formation of polities within settler colonial contexts. The project builds on a multitude of different printed, archival and oral sources. Extensive archival research will be conducted in Windhoek, Cape Town, London, Wuppertal and Berlin. In order to discern African voices and their agency from colonial documents, a variety of reading methods will be applied and combined with oral evidence.","Afrika, Geschichte, Gewalt, Kolonialgeschichte, Namibia, Südafrika",external_funding,Active,3949655,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,206,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

"Warburton, Richard",NA,Departement Physik / Experimental Physics (Warburton),Electro-optics of semiconductor nanostructures III,2017,"Quantum communication and quantum computation offer compelling advantages over their classical counterparts. Quantum communication over short distances is a reality; over long distances it is not. A fully-fledged quantum computer remains a very distant prospect but its potential to solve hard problems in chemistry and materials science make it an extremely important goal. Application of these quantum concepts with semiconductors offers a route to creating small, fast and scalable devices. However, while the materials have powerful advantages they are also complex with several inter-connected sub-systems (electronic charge, electronic spin, nuclear spins, phonons, photons). The physics of these materials, particularly with structure on the nano-scale, needs to be understood. The overriding goal of this project is to make leading contributions to the development of semiconductor-based quantum technology. There are three inter-linked strands, development of a quantum device, an investigation into some of the key physics, and an exploration of new materials.Tunable quantum dots in a tunable micro-cavityA self-assembled quantum dot has emerged as a leading contender for a source of single photons. The photons should be bright, pure and indistinguishable. Quantum dots far beneath the surface of the semiconductor emit pure and highly indistinguishable photons but the brightness is poor on account of the difficulties of extracting photons from the high-index semiconductor. High-brightness devices rely on nano-fabrication. In many cases, the nano-fabrication is both complex and invasive such that device yield is poor, and the photon purity and indistinguishable suffer. The proposal here is to solve this conundrum by embedding electrically-contacted quantum dots in a vertical micro-cavity: tunable quantum dots in a tunable micro-cavity. Nano-fabrication is bypassed: the quantum dots in the device are guaranteed to have ultra-high quality; contacting the device is trivial. The mirrors are built with known, ultra-high quality materials and techniques. Calculations show that two ideal limits can be reached, optimized photon collection and strong coupling. Remarkably, only a modest micro-cavity finesse (~1,000) is required for ultra-high photon extraction. These ideas will be implemented paying attention to all the crucial details which have hindered progress in the past. The technology will be simplified in order to create a device. An efficient spin-photon interface will be built by trapping a single spin (either electron or hole) in the quantum dot. Spin-photon entanglement protocols will be applied, and, on success, entanglement swapping operations to create high-rate spin-spin entanglements.Phononics with an embedded quantum dotThe electron-phonon interaction results in spin dephasing in a semiconductor. This is not inevitable. The phonon modes and their occupations can be controlled, a process of ""phononics"". Compared to ""photonics"", phononics has received almost no attention in the context of quantum dots. A phononic crystal will be created with a gap in the density of states in the few-GHz regime. When the electron spin Zeeman frequency lies in this gap, phonon-related spin relaxation should be suppressed. Conversely, the spin relaxation rate will be used to probe the local phonon density of states. A localized high-Q phonon mode will be created by using a phononic crystal to shield a small element from the bulk phonon modes. An embedded quantum dot will couple to the localized phonon mode. The aim is to reach the resolved sideband regime which allows the phonon number to be controlled, possibly to the phonon ground state, by optically driving the quantum dot.Quantum photonics with 2D semiconductorsThe only known way of ""wiring up"" self-assembled quantum dots is via photons. A ""circuit"" of self-assembled quantum dots does not exist largely because the quantum dots must be located deep below the surface. A tantalizing prospect is to create a quantum dot circuit with a two-dimensional semiconductor where, by its very nature, all the action takes place on or very close to the surface. Only the most rudimentary quantum dot-like elements exist in this materials class, for instance confined excitons in WSe2.

To identify possible building blocks of a more fundamental theory, and to investigate how to probe them with the data of future experiments, my research project focuses on three challenges, associated with three subprojects. Subproject A: One of the great challenges of the present Standard Model (SM) of elementary particle physics is the origin of neutrino masses. In subproject A we plan to contribute towards resolving this open question by investigating systematically how the mechanism of neutrino mass generation can be probed best in future experiments, in particular at possible future electron-positron, proton-proton and electron-proton colliders such as the ILC, FCC-ee, CLIC, CEPC, HL-LHC, FCC-hh/SppC, LHeC and the FCC-eh. Subproject B: Towards the challenge of identifying a more fundamental theory framework behind the SM of elementary particles, subproject B will contribute to the development of (more) predictive Grand Unified Theory (GUT) models, exploring for instance new classes of models in SO(10), as well as to the development of tools for their precision analysis (focusing on GUT predictions for baryon number violating nucleon decays, sparticle masses and neutrino properties). Subproject C: When constructing models for the early universe, one of the great challenges is linking the phase of cosmic inflation to the later phase of the universe where, e.g., the matter-antimatter asymmetry and the dark matter are produced. In subproject C we will contribute to clarifying this link by calculating the intermediate ""reheating phase"", including the production of gravitational waves and non-perturbative phenomena like ""oscillons"", after particle physics motivated classes of ""hilltop"" and ""hybrid-like"" inflation models.

The latter report points out that majority of people lives in polluted air which causes re-occurring episodes of lung inflammation and can lead to asthma. In 2016, The EU Symposium on the Awareness of Allergy declared that: ""chronic airway diseases are a major and growing health problem in Europe"".Asthma is the most prevalent chronic airway disease affecting 8 % of the world's population and the number of patient doubles every 10 years. Despite being a heterogeneous disease, the major pathologies are chronic airway inflammation and airway wall remodeling. In most patients inflammation can be well controlled by anti-inflammatory drugs, but airway wall thickening cannot be reduced by any available drug. Today, only bronchial thermoplasty in severe asthma showed lasting symptom relief after reducing airway wall thickness by destroying sub-epithelial mesenchymal cells. Therefore, leading experts in the field recently suggested that unless the mechanism driving airway wall remodeling is better understood, there will be no cure for asthma. Airway wall remodeling includes: (a) dysfunction of the bronchial epithelium, (b) hypertrophy / hyperplasia of sub-epithelial mesenchymal cells, (d) increased mitochondrial activity, and (d) increased deposition of sub-epithelial extracellular matrix. New clinical studies showed that sub-epithelial mesenchymal cells release pro-inflammatory cytokines that recruit immune cells into the airways. We and others demonstrated that remodeling of human asthmatic airway smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts is due to increased Erk1/2 MAP kinase activity, PRMT1 expression and mitochondrial mass, which are the consequence of reduced C/EBP-a expression and low levels of microRNA-19a.These studies were performed in cells isolated from more than 150 asthma patients which were collected at six hospitals from Switzerland (Basel), Italy (Naples), Belgium (Liege), Canada (Manitoba), and Australia (Sydney: Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Royal North Shore Hospital).Referring to our earlier studies, we aim to prove that the expression of microRNA cluster 17-92 members is controlled by the ratio of C/EBP-a to C/EBP-ß. We hypothesize that the earlier reported low level of C/EBP-a in asthmatic smooth muscle cells increases the binding of C/EBP-ß to the microRNA cluster 17-92 promoter and leads to remodeling. This hypothesis will be tested in tissue sections and in isolated, diseased versus non-diseased human airway smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. We will assess: 1) the functional link of the C/EBP-a to C/EBP-ß ratio on the expression of microRNA cluster 17-92 members. 2) the mechanism by which how C/EBP-a and -ß regulate the microRNA cluster 17-92 promoter activity by electrophoretic DNA mobility shift assay, DNA-protein precipitation assay, and luciferase reporter construct. 3) the consequence of C/EBP-a and/or C/EBP-ß knock-out in airway cells on microRNA cluster 17-92 control of Erk1/2 MAPK activity, STAT1 activity and PRMT1 expression; and 4) on mitochondria mass, mitochondrial activity, cell proliferation and extra cellular matrix deposition which all indicate remodeling.

CV risk factors such as hypertension or obesity oftentimes manifest during childhood. The prevalence of high blood pressure and body mass index (BMI) in childhood continues to rise. Both these cardiovascular risk factors have been shown to track into adulthood with higher cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates later in life. Alterations of vascular structure and function can be validated by use of non-invasive measurements of vascular biomarkers. Retinal vessel diameters are valid and sensitive microvascular biomarkers that have been shown to be associated with CVD in adulthood and CV risk factors in childhood. In adults, narrower arteriolar and wider venular diameters have been shown to be predictive of future hypertension, coronary artery disease and stroke. Few studies have demonstrated similar findings in young children, indicating that retinal vessel alterations correlate with high blood pressure and unfavourable body composition early in life. To date, no data is available on the associations between retinal vessel diameters and the development of high blood pressure over a longer period during childhood years. Our study aims to fill this research gap and to investigate further the long-term influence of physical activity and fitness on retinal vessel diameters, blood pressure, BMI and psychosocial health in children. We hypothesise that narrower retinal arteries are associated with the development of higher blood pressure during a four-year follow-up in children. Furthermore, children who show an increase in physical fitness during the follow-up are postulated to have favourable retinal vessel diameter changes, lower blood pressure and BMI as well as lower levels of perceived psychosocial stress compared to their peers that remained on the same physical fitness level. The study is designed as a population-based prospective cohort study, the baseline of which was performed four years previously. In 2014, 1255 primary school children of the Canton Basel-Stadt took part in physical fitness tests and BMI measurements during physical education lessons. 340 first-grader (7.3 years (SD 0.4)) were allowed by their parents to take part in the additional medical tests. Assessments included retinal vessel analysis, blood pressure, BMI, psychosocial health, proxy-reported questionnaires and physical fitness tests. In 2018, the children will again participate in the same setting. For the fitness tests and BMI measurements, approximately 1000 are expected to have complete data from 2014 and 2018. With respect to the medical tests, at least 250 of the previous 340 children are expected to have complete data from baseline and the four-year follow-up. Our timeline will enable us to perform all measurements and data collection of the follow-up in 2018, allow for data entry and cleaning, data merging and retinal image analysis in 2019 and to publish and disseminate the results in 2020. A multiple linear regression analysis using blood pressure at follow-up as outcome will be conducted to analyse the associations between retinal vessel diameters and the development of high blood pressure. To analyse whether changes in physical activity and fitness during the four-year follow-up are associated with retinal vessel diameters, BMI, blood pressure and psychosocial health, linear mixed regression models will be calculated using school as random effect. For a sample size of 250 children with complete data, using the estimated effect size and residual standard deviation of the 2014 baseline data, the power is estimated to be around 95%. The study offers a unique integral concept that aims to set the grounds for a healthy and active lifestyle approach during childhood.

"Jiskra, Martin",NA,Departement Umweltwissenschaften,Seasonal impact of vegetation on atmospheric elemental mercury dry deposition,2017,"Mercury (Hg) is a global pollutant of great concern for human and ecosystem health. The UNEP Minamata Convention on Hg aims to curb global anthropogenic Hg emissions, yet has to balance economic and environmental interests. Major knowledge gaps on the role of terrestrial surfaces in the complex global Hg cycling however hamper a science-based assessment of Hg emission reduction scenarios. This in turn undermines the effectiveness of the UNEP Minamata Convention and calls for new scientific approaches to address this prevailing uncertainty associated with terrestrial Hg cycling.The current paradigm suggests that anthropogenic gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) emissions are oxidized in the atmosphere to reactive HgII forms before depositing through rain, snow and dust to Earth surfaces. Hg stable isotope fingerprint studies however revealed that Hg in continental vegetation and soils corresponds to the isotopic fingerprints of GEM rather than HgII in precipitation. There is now increasing evidence that GEM uptake by vegetation represents a massive, overlooked deposition pathway. The latter would imply that vegetation as a GEM pump could significantly affect the GEM lifetime in the atmosphere and change our understanding of global atmospheric Hg cycling. The goal of this project is to resolve this apparent paradox and better understand the importance of GEM uptake by vegetation relative to HgII deposition by rain and snowfall.The short-term balance between Hg deposition and (re)-emission processes governs the seasonal GEM variations. In Europe, GEM concentrations peak in wintertime and are generally attributed to higher anthropogenic GEM emissions from fossil fuel burning in winter. This conclusion is however unconstrained and seasonal variations in GEM deposition (e.g. less plant uptake during the winter) or oxidation processes have been suggested as alternative explanations. This project aims to assess the impact of GEM uptake by vegetation on global Hg cycling and quantify this unconstrained flux to terrestrial ecosystems using a combination of novel stable Hg isotope analysis, remote sensing data and modeling approaches. The objectives are to:(1)Understand the processes controlling seasonal GEM variation by investigating the isotopic fingerprint of GEM at six European sites to differentiate between the role of foliar GEM uptake and primary anthropogenic GEM emissions.(2)Quantify the flux of GEM uptake by foliage and assess its relevance for total Hg deposition in comparison to HgII wet deposition for continental Europe by analyzing seasonal evolution and spatial variability of the Hg pool in foliage at 10 sites along a transect through Europe.(3)Assess the magnitude of the foliar GEM uptake flux for Europe by extrapolating the site-based measurements to a continental scale using satelite-based remote sensing data on vegetation coverage.(4)Improve the parameterization of foliar GEM uptake in global mercury models and to quantify the global foliar GEM uptake flux with a global isotope mass balance.

The different therapeutic options proposed are predominately palliative and still far from being effective in reversing the pathology. We recently demonstrated that nasal chondrocytes (NC) can be used clinically for repair of traumatic articular cartilage defects in the knee. The possibility to extend indications of NC to stages of early osteoarthritis would represent a step forward in this area of research. The development of reliable OA in vitro models is thus of primary importance to advance the research into causes and to design potential therapeutics. Different innovative approaches have been proposed, relying on the generation of 3D cartilage/osteochondral constructs obtained through biomaterials and/or bioreactor. However, integrating all key components of OA environment in a single system still remains an open challenge. Working hypothesis. In the proposed research, we will use a microfluidic hydrogel platform to generate physiological and pathological models of osteochondral units. The model will be first exploited to elucidate mechanisms of cartilage/bone cross talk during the triggering of OA, and subsequently to screen novel OA disease-modifying compounds. Specifically, we hypothesize that factors released by nasal chondrocytes are potential novel candidates as OA disease-modifying compounds.Specific aims. We will first address the generation of a 3D microscale hydrogel model of a human osteochondral (OC) unit, consisting of a cartilaginous layer integrated with an endothelialized bone layer (Aim1). We will then switch the OC healthy model towards OA phenotype, by perturbing it through inflammatory treatments, pathological/physiological-like mechanical loadings and their combination (Aim2). The OA model will be then used to investigate the main molecular pathways involved in the cross talk between cartilage and bone cells during the triggering of the pathology (Aim3). Finally, we will exploit the generated model to test the anti-OA effect of factors released by NC, based on their capacity to reverse OA like traits (Aim4).Experimental design. A microscale platform will be developed, comprising a 3D spatially organized co-culture module, equipped with an integrated system for biochemical and mechanical stimulation. A healthy model of OC unit will be first established, consisting of a cartilaginous layer (generated by human articular chondrocytes, AC) integrated with a bone layer (generated by human mesenchymal stem/stromal cells - MSC - or osteoblasts). The feasibility of AC and MSC/osteoblasts to differentiate into phenotypically stable and integrated cartilage-bone composites and the ingrowth of a vascular-like structure within the bone layer will be evaluated. To switch from healthy to OA-like phenotype, the OC unit will be exposed to inflammatory factors (IL-1ß, TNF-a, IFN-?) and/or mechanical loadings. Responses of the system in terms of cartilage/bone matrix degradation, inflammatory and nociceptive markers will be assessed. Bone/cartilage cross talk will be assessed by exposing each layer to conditioned medium collected from the insulted complementary layer, and the role of key molecular pathways will be evaluated (i.e. TGFß/BMP and Wnt/ßCatenin). Finally, factors released by NC will be characterized and used to counteract inflammatory/pain/degrading responses previously induced, together with drugs demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory effects in animal studies. Expected value of the proposed project. Our study will lead to the establishment of the first on-chip in vitro OA model able to recapitulate the key-features of a human osteochondral joint, relevant for gaining insights into OA pathophysiology and anti-OA drug development.

This is largely due to the wide spectrum of possible applications, the potential to deliver multiple services (revenue stacking), and unclear market developments which make economic assessments difficult. To the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive cost-based analysis considering the potential role of bulk and distributed technologies for Switzerland has been performed to date that could inform a comprehensive national energy storage strategy. The objective of the proposed research project is to address this gap by performing a holistic investigation of the role of competing and/or complementary electric, thermal and chemical energy storage technologies in achieving greater penetration of renewable energy technologies and more efficient and effective use of energy in the context of the Swiss energy transition. In the first task, comprehensive, detailed and robust information and data on the status of, and prospects for, technical and cost performance of selected storage technologies will be collected to serve as a basis for an expert elicitation exercise. This will help identify drivers of future cost reduction and technical improvement, and deliver cost and performance estimates under a range of scenarios.

When this happens, they form protein complexes which remain bound together for extended periods of time and resist coming apart under thermal stress. Directed evolution is a method that is used in biotechnology to evolve artificial proteins in the laboratory that are not found in nature. Researchers use this technique to isolate molecules that have strong binding interactions with any other protein they choose. Such approaches are being used to develop new types of antibody therapies for cancer, as well as to produce targeted nanoparticles that locally deliver therapeutic molecules to precise locations in the body. Typically, the strength of protein binding interactions is evaluated by measuring the amount of time the protein complex remains assembled at a given temperature in an aqueous environment. However, there is also a different way to measure binding strength, and that is to measure the amount of mechanical force that a protein complex can withstand before breaking. Although these two factors are related, there are many cases where in fact the binding strength measured using these two different approaches differs widely. Such cases can arise when the protein complex becomes activated under force, similar to a Chinese finger trap which strengthens under force. The goal of this project is to develop new techniques for isolating affinity proteins that are stable under mechanical load. We are using cutting edge methods involving microfluidics, atomic force microscopy, biotechnology and directed evolution to identify artificial proteins which have extreme stability under mechanical load.

"Gagneux, Sebastien",NA,Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH) / Tuberculosis Research (Gagneux),Host-pathogen genomic interactions and their phenotypic impact in human tuberculosis,2017,"Human tuberculosis (TB) remains a global public health problem and the main cause of human death due to an infectious disease. TB is caused by a group of closely related bacteria known as the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex (MTBC). The outcome of TB infection and disease is highly variable, ranging from rapid bacterial clearance by innate immunity and life-long asymptomatic latent infection to active pulmonary- and extra-pulmonary disease. This variation has traditionally been attributed to host and environmental factors. Indeed, early twin studies have demonstrated a high degree of heritability in TB susceptibility. However, more recent human genetic studies have largely failed to identify TB susceptibility loci reproducibly. The limited success of these studies partially stems from the fact that the role of human variation has rarely been studied together with pathogen variation. The human-adapted MTBC is an obligate human pathogen with no animal or environmental reservoir that has affected humankind for thousands of years. Hence, co-evolution between humans and the human-adapted MTBC is likely to have contributed to some of the characteristics of the host-pathogen interactions in human TB. This notion is supported by evidence for local adaptation of different MTBC genotypes to particular human populations that are perturbed by HIV co-infection. However, formal demonstration of host-pathogen co-evolution in human TB is lacking. Moreover, no study to date has explored the combined effects of human- and MTBC genomic variation on clinically relevant phenotypes. The goal of this project is to test for genetic and functional evidence of host-pathogen co-evolution in human TB, and explore the joint effects of human and pathogen variation on ex vivo and in clinico phenotypes, including those associated with virulence and disease severity, immunogenicity, patient outcome, and bacterial transmission. We hypothesize that i) paired human- and MTBC genome data from TB patients exhibit signals of host-pathogen co-evolution that are perturbed by HIV co-infection, ii) MTBC genomic variation is driven by specific human genomic variation in TB patients (and/or vice versa), iii) MTBC virulence and transmission phenotypes measured ex vivo and in clinico vary as a function of the particular combination of human- and bacterial genotypes, and iv) specific interacting host- and bacterial genomic loci are associated with these phenotypic differences. We will test these hypotheses by addressing the following three Specific Objectives:1)Detect and characterize signals of host-pathogen co-evolution in the paired genome-wide diversity data from HIV-negative and HIV-coinfected TB patients and their cognate MTBC strains from Tanzania;2)Identify and validate interacting genomic loci in the paired genomes of TB patients and their MTBC isolates associated with ex vivo, in clinico and epidemiological phenotypes;3)Measure the virulence, immunogenicity and transmission of TB in Tanzanian patients as a function of human- and MTBC genomic diversity.This projects benefits from the multidisciplinary and complementary expertise of the study team, and from access to an ongoing cohort of TB patients in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania that is separately funded. Through this cohort, we have access to 1,200 TB patients who have already been recruited and consented, as well as to the relevant patient information, blood samples for human genomic studies, their MTBC isolates and genome sequences. In addition to analyzing these retrospective data, we will get access to samples from 650 prospectively recruited TB patients during the first two years of the project, and perform additional assays to validate and complement the findings from the retrospective analyses.

"Stahlberg, Henning",NA,Departement Biozentrum / Structural Biology (Stahlberg); Departement Biozentrum,SINERGIA: Molecular and Cellular Modulation in Parkinson's Disease,2017,"  Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a prominent and severe neurodegenerative disease that affects about 2% of our population, particularly the elderly. It is considered to be one of the protein aggregation diseases, which also include Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease. In PD, dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) region of the brain are lost, yielding the typical disease symptoms of tremor or slowness of movement and rigidity. The pathological hallmarks of PD are large aggregates within the affected neurons, which are called Lewy bodies or Lewy neurites, and which are composed of lipids and the protein alpha-synuclein (&#945;-Syn). Familial PD is often related to mutants at the &#945;-Syn gene locus, while recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified several other so called ""PD risk genes"". Despite several decades of intensive research on PD, the molecular mechanism behind neurodegeneration and the protein players involved are not known. Early diagnosis of the disease with positron-emission tomography (PET) is so far not possible, because a suitable protein target for a PET tracer has not been identified. So far, medical treatment of PD can only weaken the symptoms of the disease, it cannot prevent, slow-down or stop disease progression. No cell line or animal model is considered to be fully representative of the disease. In this 4-year Sinergia project, we will study PD from a structural perspective in situ, using human brain tissue and fluids from PD patients. We will translate this information to the cellular level and to animal models for detailed structural, dynamic and cell biological analysis, and compare these findings with those obtained from human samples. In parallel, we will analyze the structural and mechanistic consequences of ""PD risk gene"" proteins within model cells. This project will use systems-biology screens, GWAS PD risk gene analysis, and three complementary structural methods: Cryo-electron microscopy and tomography will be used to elucidate both protein conformations and tissue structure at high resolution, conformation-sensitive mass spectrometry based on limited proteolysis will be used to fingerprint the structures and alterations of structures of various proteins, comparing those present in healthy and PD tissue and model cells, and finally, in-cell nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) will be used to determine the 3D structure and dynamics of the proteins, including the identification of transient interactors of &#945;-Syn and other proteins of interest, at near-atomic resolution within the cells. These three structural methods are able to study structures and structural alterations within the physiological milieu. This will be complemented with a systems biology approach at the cell level to elucidate the biological consequences of the structural alterations. The proteins encoded by the PD risk genes will be characterized for their structural and biochemical impact on the biology of the cell. And finally, the structure and function of specific, identified proteins of interest with relevancy in PD neurodegeneration will be determined. The unique combination of methods employed here, and their application to human PD brain tissue, and cell and animal models for PD will allow screens to be made for novel proteins that may be so far unrecognized players in the development of PD. This research will provide a better mechanistic insight into the molecular processes underlying the progression of neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease, and may identify novel PET tracers or even drug targets to help understand and treat this debilitating disease.

The understanding and ability to manipulate phonons as quantum particles in solids enable the control of coherent phonon transport, which is of fundamental interest and could also be exploited in applications. Logic operations can be realized with the manipulation of phonons both in their coherent and incoherent form in order to switch, amplify, and route signals, and to store information.

The ""Ageing as Future"" project investigates how individuals perceive, construe, and prepare for their old age and ageing. We address this topic from an interdisciplinary perspective, combining different methodological approaches that mutually complement and inform each other (in-depth interviews, questionnaires, online assessments, experiments). The project has an international format, with data collection in three different countries (Germany, USA, Hong Kong), which allows us to study and compare processes of ageing across different societal contexts. The design of our study enables us to interconnect individual and societal factors in understanding processes of ageing. The major topics of our project center around three interrelated themes: Views on ageing, preparation for old age, and time management in old age. During the first funding period, the project has generated a data base that is unique with respect to its multi-method approach and its in-depth assessment of age-related variables and constructs in three different countries. Core findings focus on (a) the domain-specificity of views on ageing and age-related preparation, (b) processes of internalization of age stereotypes into personalized future self-views, (c) relations between ageing-related beliefs and a wide range of developmental outcomes (e.g., preparation, life events, perceived age discrimination, subjective age, well-being), (d) modes of time management and time perception (time suspension, logic of catching up, temporal self-continuity), and (e) country differences in ageing-related processes and their determinants (perceived situation of older people in a society, age stereotypes). Besides of having a strong impact on ageing research (high ranking publications, symposia at national and international conferences), we have also disseminated our research findings to the public (handbook introducing the project and its core results, educational materials, presence in the media, press releases).In a second funding period, the project will capitalize on and expand the current data base. Specifically, we will conduct additional measurement waves, resulting in a fully longitudinal, multimethod design across multiple countries. These data will allow us to separate effects of age, cohort, and historical time; to investigate the causal direction of relations between variables; and to compare and interconnect findings and insights that were gathered with different methodologies within different parts of the project. Furthermore, two countries will be added to our project. Data will be gathered in the Czech Republic in order to investigate effects of societal transformation on individual attitudes towards ageing in a country that changed from a state socialist, highly protectionist welfare regime to a capitalist society emphasizing individual liberty and responsibility. We also include data collection in the Tainan region in Taiwan in order to compare processes of ageing between more rural and metropolitan regions (Hong Kong) in Asia.

However, the traits that result from natural selection only occasionally overlap with features of biomolecules that are sought by humans for engineering applications and/or therapeutic purposes. In order to guide molecular evolution and access useful artificial properties more frequently, directed evolution in the laboratory has been used to mimic natural evolution. A diverse library of genes is translated into a corresponding library of proteins and screened/selected for functional variants in a manner that maintains the correspondence between genotype (genes) and a desired phenotype (proteins and their functions). These functional mutant genes are replicated and serve as starting points for subsequent rounds of diversification and screening. Over many generations, these beneficial mutations accumulate, resulting in a successively improved phenotype for specific biological events. Here, we aim to enhance protein receptor-ligand interactions using directed evolution for biomedical applications. First, a protein-engineering approach will be used to increase the possibilities of enhancing the desired properties of a cohesion (Coh) domain. This domain has been reported to form a complex with its corresponding ligand with outstanding stability, and is also highly resistant to unfolding under mechanical tension. The biophysical properties of this domain can therefore be considered ideal. We are undertaking various bioinformatic analyses for efficient library design, focused on effective residue site-saturation and while keeping WT bias. Once the focused library is designed, diversity generation of Coh takes place by means of molecular cloning and wide site-saturation mutagenesis on residues of the selected loops using oligo-based in vitro gene assembly.

The theory of TQC progressed very rapidly during the last decade from various qubit realizations to scalable computational protocols. However, the experimental realizations of these concepts lag behind. Important experimental milestones have been achieved recently, by demonstrating the first signatures of Majorana states which are the simplest non-Abelian anyons. However, to realize fully topologically protected universal quantum computation, more exotic anyons, such as parafermions are required. Thus, the unambiguous demonstration of parafermion states will have a great impact on the development of universal quantum computation. The experimental realization of parafermions is challenging, since they are based on the combination of various ingredients, such as crossed Andreev reflection, electron-electron or spin-orbit interaction, and high quality quantum conductors. Thus, the investigation of all these ingredients is essential and timely to achieve further experimental progress. The team of SuperTop is composed of six leading groups with strong and complementary experimental background in these areas with the aim to realize parafermions in double nanowire-based hybrid devices (DNW) for the first time. The main objectives of SuperTop are: a) development of different DNW geometries, which consist of two parallel 1D spin-orbit nanowires coupled by a thin superconductor stripe and b) investigation of the emerging exotic bound states at the superconductor/semiconductor interface of the DNW.   SuperTop first grows state-of-the-art InAs and InSb based nanostructures, in particular InAs nanowires (NWs) with in-situ grown epitaxial superconducting layer, NWs with built-in InP barriers and InSb nanoflakes. Based on these high quality materials, different device geometries of DNW are fabricated and the emerging novel states are investigated. The topological character, quantum phase transition, coherence time, coupling strength to QED as key features of the engineered new states are planned to be addressed by various cutting-edge low temperature measurement techniques (e.g. non-local spectroscopy, noise, current-phase relationship measurement or integration into coplanar resonators).

They occur due to the aberrant muscle use under the neurological disorder and further impede function and daily activities. Foot equinus is one of the most frequent conditions, and treatment with injection of botulinum toxin has become a standard. In this study the functional properties of muscles - before and after the injection of botulinum toxin - in cerebral palsy patients will be assessed with a novel technique for the investigation of muscle function by MRI, based on synchronous electrical muscle stimulation (EMS). This approach provides information about muscle fibre length and angulation also in the active muscle, as well as contraction velocity and muscle strength. These data will be correlated with muscle pathology from needle biopsies and with gait function recorded by gait analysis. Synchronous EMS-MRI and gait analysis including dynamic superficial electromyography (EMG) will be applied three times to the patients: a) Before botulinum toxin injection, b) 6 weeks after botulinum toxin injection, and c) 3 months after botulinum toxin injection. Before botulinum toxin injection a needle biopsy of the selected muscle will be obtained from all patients. Muscle tissue is altered in cerebral palsy, and the biopsy provides the necessary histological data for understanding a possible atypical function before and after botulinum toxin injection assessed with EMS-induced MRI. For data comparison twelve healthy volunteers will be recruited whose data will serve as a normal reference. The volunteers will only obtain synchronous EMS-MRI and gait analysis including dynamic superficial EMG once. As we have histology data of normal muscles, biopsies and botulinum toxin injections are not required in these normal volunteers.The data of synchronous EMS-MRI from this study will be clinically relevant for several reasons:It may offer a non-invasive technique to obtain information on muscle pathophysiology in patients with cerebral palsy. A better knowledge of the function of the abnormal muscles during gait is essential for the adaptation of the current treatment options (e.g. less surgical lengthenings). It will further help to compute data from gait analysis more accurately as the parameters modifying the computations can be set according to the pathologies.Further, the information about the effect of botulinum toxin may help to explain some of the failures of current treatment procedures.

The past years of research into rumination have demonstrated nearly consistently that it is involved in the maintenance and symptom severity of various mental disorders (Ehring &amp; Watkins, 2008). Surprisingly, however, its role in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has been neglected and remains unclear so far. This is particularly unsatisfactory since co-morbidity between depression and OCD is high (23% current and 63% life-time co-morbidity; Adam, Meinlschmidt, Gloster &amp; Lieb, 2012; Schuurmans et al., 2012), and various studies have demonstrated that rumination is involved in the onset and worsening of depression and also comorbid depression (e.g. Drost, Van der Does, VanHemert, Penninx, &amp; Spinhoven, 2014; Just &amp; Alloy, 1997; Olantunji, Naragon-Gainey, &amp; Wolitzky-Taylor, 2013). This study aims to evaluate data on the imminent and intermediate effects of rumination on obsessive-compulsive symptom severity and depressive mood. Do OC symptoms and depressive mood exacerbate after rumination? Methods: The effects of rumination on OC symptom severity and depressive mood will be examined in an experimental study, followed by three additional ambulatory assessments of OC symptoms and depressed mood. Following an activation of obsessional thoughts, individuals diagnosed with OCD (N=90) will be asked to monitor the frequency of their obsessive thoughts, associated distress, urge to neutralize and depressed mood before and after an experimental manipulation. During the experimental phase, they will be instructed to either think about their individual symptoms in a repetitive, unproductive way ('rumination'), or to think about neutral images and scenes ('distraction') for 8 minutes. Experimental conditions will be randomly allocated, stratified by gender. Frequency of thoughts will be measured with a counter app, accompanying distress, urge to neutralize and depressed mood on appraisal ratings (1-10). Symptoms will also be measured in the first twelve hours after the session using ambulatory assessments with smartphones. Expected outcomes: We hypothesize that rumination has an immediate negative effect on OC symptom severity. This means we expect increases in frequency of obsessive thoughts, associated distress, urge to neutralise and also in depressed mood in comparison to distraction. We also expect the effects to persist beyond the experimental session. The study has the potential for highly relevant theoretical and ultimately also clinical implications. OCD and OC symptoms are common in the general population but psychopathological mechanisms are still not sufficiently understood. If results were confirmed, rumination might have to be included in the cognitive-behavioural model of OCD (e.g. Salkovskis, 1999) as an additional dysfunctional strategy that maintains the disorder in the long term. Ultimately, therapeutic interventions specifically targeting rumination in OCD would have to be developed and applied as useful supplements to established cognitive-behavioural techniques.

"Mondada, Lorenza",NA,Departement Sprach- und Literaturwissenschaften / Französische und Allgemeine Linguistik (Mondada),"From Multimodality to Multisensoriality: Language, Body, and Sensoriality in Social Interaction (intSenses)",2018,"Sensoriality is a fundamental dimension of the human experience in and of the world - since people engage in the material world using their entire body, their senses and their language. However, despite a growing interest in language and embodiment in various disciplines the role of sensoriality is still neglected. Moreover, sensoriality is often considered as relying primarily on individual and private perceptions. Although some research on the senses exists in cognitive linguistic and historical-anthropological fields, sensoriality remains largely ignored from an interactional perspective. The intSenses project aims at filling these gaps, by recognizing sensoriality a central theoretical and empirical role within an integrated model of language and body in social interaction. Rooted in conversation analysis, the project aims at developing current research on multimodality in social interaction - that is, the way participants mobilize together language, gesture, gaze, body postures and movements in order to act and communicate - on the new territory of multisensoriality - that is, the way participants collectively engage in sensorial practices involving all of the senses. More particularly, the project will develop empirical analyses of how people smell, taste, and touch food within joint activities such as cooking together, how their body and their language feature in these practices in specific and complementary ways, how they manifest publicly and communicate intersubjectively what they sense within social interaction. These empirical analyses will inspire conceptual advances, reflecting on the role of sensoriality in the multimodal organization of social interaction. Thus, the project's general aim is to propose a new approach to multisensoriality based on a multimodal approach of social interaction.  The focus of the study are sensory practices - that is, meaningful social acts of sensing - carried out via movements of the hand and the body. These sensory practices are embedded within specific courses of action and broader activities in talk and social interaction. The focus will be on the more neglected sensory practices - tasting, touching, and smelling - and their interrelationships. Gazingand hearing will also be considered as they are crucial for establishing the intersubjectivity of sensory practices. Multisensoriality will be studied using an innovative methodology involving video recordings of sensory practices and detailed multimodal transcription and analysis of these recordings. The data will document how people in authentic social settings, speaking different languages, experience their senses during ordinary activities. The analytical focus will be on the multimodal resources (language, gesture, gaze, facial expressions, body postures, movements, etc.) that organize these practices in a publicly intelligible way. This also entails the study of how language and the body, i.e. audible (verbal and vocal) and visible resources, achieve the intersubjectivity of sensory practices in social interaction. An empirical focus will be given to tasting, touching, and smelling in food activities as an exemplary domain for empirical investigations of sensoriality in action. Instances of sensory practices in selecting, preparing, and discovering food will be studied in detail.  On the one hand, the project aims at analyzing how people collectively engage in sensory practices - such as tasting food, for example - by mobilizing different aspects of their body and their language in a way that is publicly and intersubjectively intelligible.

"Christ, Emanuel","Wild, Damian",Departement Klinische Forschung,A comparison of two novel molecular targeting systems for diagnosis and therapy in patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC),2018,"Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) arises from the Calcitonin (Ctn) producing C-cell of the thyroid and accounts for 1- 2% of all thyroid cancer. Due to the unspecific signs and symptoms the patients present at a metastasized stage in 40-50% of the cases. Ctn is a reliable tumormarker and is associated with tumor mass. The diagnostic work up in order to establish the extent of disease includes conventional imaging (neck ultrasound, MRI, CT) and as molecular imaging 18F-DOPA-PET (gold standard). However, by combining these modalities there are still ca. 20% of patients with elevated Ctn levels without morphological evidence of disease (small tumor remnants). There is, therefore, an unmet need for a more sensitive diagnostic tool. The only curative approach is surgery. Conventional chemotherapy is not efficacious and targeted therapy using tyrosine kinase inhibitors stabilize, but do not cure the disease and are associated with significant toxicity. There is, therefore, and unmet need for a more effective therapeutical tool.A promising tool is targeting of peptide hormone receptors, over-expressed on the surface of MTC cells. The over-expression on MTC cells allows specific targeting of MTC with radiolabeled analogues. Both, imaging and therapy are possible with this approach (theranostic). Potential receptors are cholecystokinin-2 receptors (CCK2-R) targeted by a minigastrin analogue (177Lu-PP-F11N) and somatostatin subtype 2 receptors (sst2-R) targeted by an sst2-R antagonist (177Lu-OPS201). Both compounds are exclusively available for research in our institution.Working HypothesisBoth, 177Lu-PP-F11N and 177Lu-OPS201 are promising radiotracers for imaging and therapy of patients with MTC. Both compounds perform better than 18F-DOPA-PET and 177Lu-DOTATOC (sst2-R agonist) and will improve therapy of patients with MTC. It is currently unclear which compound performs better. Specific AimsThe performance of the two novel radiotracers 177Lu-PP-F11N and 177Lu-OPS201 will be compared with each other, with 18F-DOPA and 177Lu-DOTATOC in the same patient. The primary endpoint is the tumor-to-organ ratio (in relation to the dose limiting organ) as it is the most relevant parameter to predict the efficacy of the radiotracers.Experimental DesignPatients with a diagnosis of MTC (initial work-up or during follow-up) and elevated Ctn levels are included. They undergo 18F-DOPA-PET imaging (gold standard). 177Lu-PP-F11N and 177Lu-OPS201 imaging will be performed in a randomized cross-over order. Whole body dosimetry is done and tumor-to-organ dose ratios will be calculated (including ratios of dose limiting organs). In case of a better tumor-to-organ dose ratio with 177Lu-PP-F11N and absence of a surgical option the patients are included in a phase II trial of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) using 177Lu-PP-F11N (supported by Oncosuisse). In case of a mainly positive result with 177Lu- OPS201 and absence of a surgical option the patients will be offered peptide receptor radionuclide therapy using 177Lu-DOATOC. In the case of surgery, tissue specimens are investigated in vitro for the expression of sst2- and CCK2-R using autoradiography and compared with the obtained tumor doses of the respective radiotracers. Expected ValueThe results of this study will be crucial for the planning of a phase II study by answering the following question: (1) Which radiotracer/targeting system performs best in patients with MTC, (2) are tumor doses high enough for an efficient therapy of residual, recurrent or metastatic MTC disease and (3) are efficient tumor doses safe in relation to the dose limiting organs (i.e. stomach, bone marrow, kidney).",NA,external_funding,Active,3949252,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,250,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Contemporary genomic approaches now have identified additional oncogenic mutations that also impinge on MAPK/PI3K signaling. This has led to the new paradigm of targeted therapy, in which drugs that specifically inhibit aberrant oncogenic signaling components have been designed. A prime example is Vemurafenib, a specific inhibitor of the V600E mutated form of B-Raf. Despite spectacular initial results and low patient toxicity, vemurafenib resistance inevitably occurs on a time scale of months, precluding a long term benefit for the patient. This involves both mechanisms of non-genetic resistance, that can occur on time scales as fast as hours, and involves rewiring of signaling network feedback structures, as well as genetic resistance, which involves of acquisition secondary mutations that hardwire drug resistance. Both mechanisms contribute to re-activation of MAPK/PI3K signaling, and aberrant proliferation. The complex pathological signaling network states, as well as the large number of mutations within the MAPK/PI3K network, found in different patients, requires a larger arsenal of targeted drugs, with different modes of action, that could be used in combination therapies to efficiently block the development of cancer drug resistance.  In this proposal, we take an alternative strategy to identify novel compounds for targeted therapy. First, our approach explores the unique chemical diversity of natural products (NPs) libraries. Second, we will use assays that interrogate pathological MAPK/PI3K signaling directly within primary cultures of patient melanoma cells that harbor different primary, or drug-induced secondary mutations. Thus, this takes into account pathological signaling network feedback structures that originate from non-genetic resistance, or from different, melanoma-relevant, oncogenic mutations that now can be diagnosed using personalized medicine approaches. Unlike classically used cell free-based screening assays which do not take into account intact signaling networks, our approach has the potential to identify compounds with novel mechanisms of action that might specifically targeting pathological signaling network vulnerabilities.  Our pipeline involves state-of-the-art image-based high content screening using robust, economical assays that measure aberrant MAPK/PI3K signaling directly in melanoma patient cells. This is coupled with a powerful analytical chemistry pipeline that can rapidly prioritize NPs of interest using only minute amounts of plant/fungi crude extracts. This unique combination has the power of realizing the full promise of NP drug screening, and will identify NPs that inhibit different melanoma-relevant pathological signaling states which are not addressed by the current drugs. The project will identify novel scaffolds for medicinal chemistry efforts towards new drugs to treat melanoma using single/combination therapies. Finally, we also propose to use our imaging technologies for characterization of known drugs and newly identified compounds to assess dynamic signaling responses at the single cell level. This will provide key insights about signaling robustness and heterogeneity that might feed in the process of drug resistance, and might enable to identify potent combination therapies that efficiently shut down pathological signaling states.",NA,external_funding,Active,3949254,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,251,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

In our projected work, we will focus mainly on high-amplitude, directed self-motion, rather than on the low-amplitude, possibly random motion (such as fixational eye movements). We will be interested in the effects of saccades and smooth self-motion. Saccades are rapid, ballistic movements of the eye, which shift the image on the retina from one location to another. Smooth, global motion of the image on the retina results from eye or body movements; of particular behavioral interest is smooth pursuit motion, in which the eye rotates so as to stabilize a moving object on the retina.There are a number of technical and conceptual challenges to the study of visual processing in the presence of self-motion, which range from the design of the stimulus through recording of neuronal activity to the analysis of this activity. Saccadic motion cannot be simulated with standard stimulation devices. Different cell types in the retina come with different physiological properties and, in particular, different sensitivities to motion. In the presence of self-motion, we thus have to be able to examine processing in different cell types separately. In primates, smooth pursuit motion stabilizes a moving object on the fovea. Thus, it is important to have access to the activity of foveal cells, in which visual processing may be organized differently from processing in the periphery. Finally, global motion stimulates a large population of cells in the retina, and, hence, it is necessary to have the technological means to record from such large populations and to have the computational methods to analyze their outputs.We propose to investigate how identified types of ganglion cells, the output cells of the retina, represent visual information individually and collectively in the presence of self-motion, in non-human primate and human retinæ. We will combine expertise in engineering, biomedicine, neurobiology, and theoretical neuroscience to develop methods for adequately stimulating the retina and for recording the spiking activity from large populations of genetically and functionally identified ganglion cells. The use of a large microelectrode array to record simultaneously from the fovea and the periphery, together with computational analyses of the recorded activity, will allow us to characterize foveal and peripheral processing and their interaction.Our projected work will be innovative along several directions. First, it will provide the first description of the responses of identified human retinal ganglion cells. Second, it will yield insights about visual computations by neurons, through the analysis of the activity of a large fraction of the retina submitted to self-motion. Third, it will put forth a first paradigm for the study of the interaction between fovea and periphery in non-human primate and human retinæ. While the study of vision in the presence of self-motion has a long history in psychophysics, comparatively little is known on processing in neural circuits. Our proposed investigations will contribute to filling this gap.",NA,external_funding,Active,4479051,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,252,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

About 2-15% of incident cases are due to known pathogenic germline variants. Approximately 5% of breast cancer cases and 10-15% of epithelial ovarian cancer cases develop due to the BRCA genes, which are associated with Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC). Lynch syndrome (LS) accounts for about 2-5% of colorectal cancer and endometrial cancers, and increased risk for other cancers including ovarian and pancreatic. Germline pathogenic variants in the DNA Mismatch Repair (MMR) account for most LS cases. The availability of genetic services for HBOC and LS is a significant milestone for effective cancer prevention and control. Genetic counseling can educate patients and cancer-free individuals about cancer risk and management options according to mutation status. For every carrier of a pathogenic germline variant, first- and second-degree relatives and first cousins have increased probability of carrying the same mutation. Due to availability of genetic testing, blood relatives can be tested with 100% accuracy. Cancer predisposition cascade genetic screening is a sequential process of identifying and testing blood relatives of a known mutation carrier. Goals of cascade screening are to determine if untested relatives also carry the pathogenic variant and propose preventive and clinical management options to reduce morbidity and mortality, and to identify non-carrier relatives and exclude them from intensive medical interventions. This approach has been strongly supported by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Office for Public Health Genomics. In Switzerland less than 25% of cases indicative of HBOC or LS use genetic services, suggesting that many mutation carriers and their blood relatives may not benefit from advances in medical diagnostics. HBOC and LS patients can benefit from intensive surveillance, pharmacoprevention, and/or prophylactic surgery. Monitoring cancer surveillance of mutation carriers ensures adequate quantity and quality of cancer care and coordination of healthcare services. Moreover, penetrance of these pathogenic mutations varies, and is likely influenced by modifiable behavioral and psychosocial risk factors, such as smoking, alcohol, and unhelpful coping with cancerrelated stress (e.g., avoidance and withdrawal). However, information about practices related to cancer screening, risk reduction, and cancer surveillance, and about modifiable behavioral and psychosocial risk factors can be obtained only from prospective family-based studies. Currently, there are no family-based cohorts for HBOC and LS in Switzerland. This critical information will provide evidence across the full continuum of cancer risk and support the development of targeted risk modification and preventive interventions. The purpose of this application is to support the development of the CASCADE cohort, a Swiss- and familybased cohort enriched for hereditary cancer risk by including members of families harboring germline pathogenic variants associated with HBOC and LS. The CASCADE cohort will facilitate the collection of epidemiological, cancer surveillance, behavioral, and psychosocial data, which over time will assist in finding sustainable solutions and developing interventions that optimize the Swiss healthcare system in preventing, managing and treating HBOC and LS. This application is submitted on behalf of the Swiss Cancer Predisposition Cascade Screening (CASCADE) Consortium, an inter-professional research consortium with scientists from basic, clinical, and social science from the German-, French-, and Italian-speaking regions of Switzerland. The purpose of the consortium is to investigate the use and impact of genetic testing for HBOC and LS in Switzerland, and develop and disseminate comprehensive interventions to families harboring these pathogenic variants. Members of the consortium are excellent researchers, clinicians, and scholars in the fields of HBOC and LS in Switzerland and internationally, and their pioneering studies support the necessity of cancer predisposition cascade genetic screening for HBOC and LS.",NA,external_funding,Active,4214199,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,253,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Photography in Africa and the Poetics of Un/Making the World,2018,"Aesthetics from the margins embarks on an historical inquiry into the place of photography in cultural ways of world-making in Africa. The project proceeds on the assumption that while ""the world"" is economically, politically and socially produced it nevertheless needs to be perceived, sensed, comprehended and made sense of. The world is, in other words, more than a mere reality, fact or given, but the result of continuous making and remaking. The ability to imagine the world and one's own place within it - individually and collectively - rests upon diverse repertoires of images, signs and symbols, idioms and narratives, media and social practices. It hence goes without saying that there has been a long-standing interest in world-making across various disciplines - among them history, philosophy, anthropology, religious, literary and cultural studies - to understand how precisely people make world(s), and how experiencing the world is linked to ideation, knowledge production, subjectivity and consciousness. But, as has recently been noted, in the so-called ""age of globalisation"" and ""media society"", and in the context of a growing preoccupation with the world's complexity and opacity, and presently its political, economic and ecological fragility, the question of world-making is of particular importance to both the humanities and social sciences, and society at large. Proposing a study of African colonial and postcolonial photography as a contribution to this recent debate on globalization, the media and world-making cannot forebear, perhaps, to speak from a position of double marginality: ""Africa"" is often considered to be the historical and contemporary ""recipient"" of globalization, as opposed to its initiators, and even those who do insist on the continent's historically accrued place and role in the making of the world emphasise, as we shall see, economic and political issues rather than ""esoteric"" questions of aesthetics and visuality. Yet, it is precisely the assumed marginality of Africa and photography that clears a space for a critical reassessment of how we ground our thinking about history, the world, and the global.","Visuality, History, Africa, Aesthetics, Theory from the South",external_funding,Active,2339102,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,254,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Currently, strong efforts are made to demonstrate and exploit Majorana bound states (MBSs), i.e. protected zero-energy states at the ends of a topologically non-trivial superconductor. The latter is obtained by combining one-dimensional (1D) semiconducting nanowires (NWs) with a large spin-orbit interaction (SOI) with conventional superconductors. In very similar electronic devices our group already demonstrated Cooper pair splitting (CPS) [5,6], believed to be a source of spatially separated entangled electrons. However, these 1D systems are strongly limiting the device geometry and scalability, because the NWs are deposited randomly and have a considerable height, which makes the fabrication of thin superconducting contacts challenging. While standard semiconducting heterostructures like AlGaAs/AlAs are difficult to combine with superconducting or ferromagnetic contacts, graphene is a more versatile platform, but lacks the energy gap necessary for simple gate confinement, and has only a small SOI.Other 2D layered materials (LMs), like MoS2 or WSe2, have a large SOI, exhibit appreciable energy gaps, can have good transport properties [9] and can probably be contacted by thin metal contacts, all of which makes them ideal candidates for scalable and complex electronic devices based on SOI and superconductivity.The general aim of this project is to develop a semiconductor electronics platform based on large-SOI 2D layered materials, which allow us to obtain quantum confinement by electrical gating and a strong coupling to metallic superconductors and ferromagnetic materials.

The project was initiated in 2007 and started to actively enrol patients in May 2008. The project has been funded, among others, by the SNSF as the core funding agency and currently stays in its 4th funding period. The STCS has evolved into the key tool of transplantation outcome research in Switzerland and has gained rapid international recognition due to the high granularity of data and systematic sampling, resulting in a remarkable scientific output. The key strength that made the STCS a prominent research platform is that the leading national experts from various disciplines collaborate under one roof. Over the last years, the number of scientific projects conducted within the STCS network was continuously increasing, with the 100th project approved by the STCS Scientific committee in 2016. Currently, 41 publications appeared in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Transplant infectious diseases continued to be one of the key areas of interest with a particular track record of critical issues in CMV infections. New areas have emerged, such as airway microbiome assessments in lung transplant recipients, T-cell response studies of BK virus infections in renal transplant recipients or genetic host factors of various infectious diseases phenotypes. Since 2012, the STCS collects antibiotic drug resistance data and first results are expected in 2017. Also recently, the genetic dataset has been enlarged to 3000 patients with genome-wide data and 10 published genetic studies of various phenotypes. The Psychosocial Interest Group (PISG) presented novel studies on body weight evolution, the influence of drug adherence and on workability after renal transplantation. Multiple national and international partners collaborate with the STCS for knowledge- and data exchange, resulting in high-ranked publications. A new level will be achieved with the inter-cohort collaboration with the Danish Persimune cohort and the creation of a metacohort with a common research portfolio. The backbone of the STCS is the unique data structure that allows reflecting every transplant type and the monitoring of even more complicated follow-up scenarios. The data involves clinical -, organ-specific -, laboratory -, psychosocial and behavioural -, genetic and infectious disease contents prospectively collected on a long-term schedule. In parallel, bio-banking of plasma, cell and DNA samples takes place at 0 - 6 - 12 months. Moreover, the STCS is legally mandated to keep a limited-registry of non-consenting patients. By the end of 2016, the STCS centres enrolled 4023 patients with 4187 transplantations, and a total of 4392 transplanted organs. During a maximum follow-up of nearly 9 years, 545 patients died (13.5%) and only 42 patients were lost to follow-up (1%). 93% of all Swiss transplant recipients provided written informed consent to the full STCS datasets, and 99% of consenting patients contributed to the STCS bio-bank. The STCS publishes comprehensive reports for the public and key federal institutions, such as the Federal Office of Public Health, UniMedSuisse and the Swiss Highly Specialized Medicine Board. In 2017, clinical transplant experts conducted in-depth reviews of all datasets and defined the necessary adaptations for the next upgrade (STCS generation 3). Furthermore the genetic working group was created to coordinate funding of extended genotyping and regulate the further use of genetic data. By May 2017, 76 persons were working for the STCS corresponding to 23.8 full-time equivalents being financed by SNF, third party, and own funds. For the next funding period, the STCS will face a number of significant challenges. Patients will be involved more closely to specify their needs and integrate their priorities. In addition to the two randomized trials ongoing and in preparation, additional trials are planned to improve the management of infectious complications post-transplant. The immunological datasets need an update to enable high-quality immunological studies. The current data model will expend towards an interoperability platform to link hospital routine care- and lab data from the centres using the standards proposed by the Swiss Personalized Health Network (SPHN). Conclusion: At the end of four SNF funding periods, the STCS represents a transplant cohort with a patient volume largely above 4000, that experiences large international recognition and that serves a broad variety of clinical, translational, interventional, psychosocial, and health services research.

Here, I propose to investigate the molecular and ecological underpinnings of the recurrent evolution of convergent species pairs of cichlid fish in the East African Great Lakes Malawi and Tanganyika, representing some of the most iconic and striking examples of this phenomenon. The observation that the convergent cichlid species pairs in sister-lakes Malawi and Tanganyika resemble each other not only in overall body shape, but in minute details of their phenotype as well as in coloration, is in the center of the debate on whether natural selection is sufficient to explain such a degree of convergence, or whether some sort of developmental or genetic constraint is influencing the way that phenotypes are generated in nature. In a first step, we will make use of hundreds of already available whole-genome DNA sequences, conduct additional DNA and transcriptome sequencing from population samples of convergent species, and use cutting-edge computational tools to establish the molecular foundation of convergent evolution in East African cichlids. This will be accompanied by an in-depth morphological and ecological examination of the convergent forms. In addition, I plan to extend the examination of the causal factors of convergent evolution towards both ends of the phylogenetic spectrum. Specifically, I propose to also study convergence within the cichlid species-flocks of lakes Malawi and Tanganyika including species that repeatedly diverged along a lake-stream environmental gradient, as well as convergence between African lake cichlids and their eco-morphologically most comparable counterpart in the marine realm, a fish community inhabiting a coral reef. Thus, we will provide what is among the first integrative, well-powered, and genome-wide analysis of convergent evolution across both cichlids and related teleosts. Our experimental design will allow us to (i) evaluate the relative contribution of natural selection versus developmental constraints to convergent evolution; (ii) examine whether convergent (involving distantly related taxa) and parallel evolution (involving more closely related taxa) are fundamentally distinct processes; and (iii) assess whether or not there are common features in organismal diversification in fish species-flocks.",NA,external_funding,Active,3951877,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,259,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Although it is not uncommon to be born with DSD, intersexuality is still relatively unknown among the general public. Until the 1990s, early normalizing hormone and surgical treatments for intersex infants were considered the norm. Near the turn of the 21st century, thanks to the efforts of advocacy groups, a major shift occurred in the approach to the care of patients with DSD. Under the new approach, established by the 2005 International Consensus Conference in Chicago, medically unnecessary interventions are deferred until the child is old enough to decide for him/herself and full disclosure to both parents and children is the norm. The recent growth of publications and national and international research projects on DSD highlights the positive impact of the Chicago meeting on the perception, evaluation, and awareness of this issue, both in the Swiss context and abroad. Still, this interest has mostly been confined to the medical perspective. When attention has been given outside the clinical setting, discussions have often been limited to the topic of early medical interventions. Such a narrow focus on surgical outcome ignores some of the more pressing everyday problems that people with DSD face. The magnitude of these challenges is often amplified for adolescents and young adults (AYA) for whom sexuality, intimacy and appearance are sensitive subjects.

In particular, regionalist parties have become enduring and influential players in regional and (in some cases) state-level political arenas. In many cases, they have been successful in achieving greater self-government for their sub-state territories. In some cases, they even question the territorial framework of the state altogether by demanding independence. The key feature of regionalist mobilisation is the pursuit of some form of 'sub-state territorial empowerment' in the name of a specific territorial group within the state's boundaries - be it referred to as a region, nation or people - which has a distinctive territorial identity (e.g. based on ethnicity, language, culture and/or traditions) and interests (economic, cultural, political, social and/or symbolic in nature).

The development of novel cancer therapies is a major challenge for academic research and pharmaceutical industries. THERACAT aims to establish a training programme focused on the development of THERApeutic CATalysts. In this strategy, materials bearing a catalytic unit are delivered to the tumour and subsequently non-active prodrugs are administered. The prodrugs are non-toxic and therefore generate limited side effects. Only at the tumour site the catalytic particles convert the prodrugs into active compounds that generate a therapeutic effect. This approach presents several advantages on the classical drug delivery paradigm including limited side effects and prolonged efficacy. This multidisciplinary research programme will be the setting for the training of 13 ESRs.

Focusing on pathways playing a role in neuronal differentiation and degeneration, we will investigate RF-EMF effects on distinct neuronal cell populations before and during differentiation and identify molecular pathways involved in a hypothesis-free genomic approach as well as in a hypothesis-driven approach. These goals will be achieved by applying cell culture-based experimentations including neuron-like and neuronal stem/progenitor cells. Progression of differentiation and phenotypic characterization will be assessed by fluorescence microscopy of stem cell and neuronal markers combined with high-content analysis and evaluation of morphology (i.e. neurite outgrowth). These analyses will be complemented by the assessment of key players of cellular pathways (e.g. the ERK/MAP-K, PI3-K/Akt, Wnt/&#946;-catenin) underlying the morphological changes such as neurite outgrowth in a quantitative manner (e.g. by Western blotting and FRET-biosensor). Mitochondrial dysfunction during neurodegeneration was shown to increase the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Oxidative stress is a frequent early condition in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, is often observed in cells upon EMF exposure and has an evident potential to compromise genetic as well as epigenetic stability. Mitochondrial integrity, an important indicator of neuronal aging and degeneration will be investigated quantitatively. To assess the impact of RF-EMF exposure on the composition and behavior of the differentiating neural cell population, gene expression profiling (transcriptome) of single cells before and after differentiation will be performed. Cluster analysis of gene expression profiles will describe the dynamics of the cell population and potentially result in the identification of target regions with altered epigenetic modifications. Target-specific quantitation of DNA methylation and histone modifications at regulatory elements (promoter, enhancer) of identified genes, markers of neural stem cell and the neuronal lineage will be analyzed by pyrosequencing of bisulfite-converted DNA and by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP).

"Christofori, Gerhard M.",NA,Departement Biomedizin / Tumor Biology (Christofori),Is an EMT really responsible for therapy resistance and metastasis?,2018,"Epithelial cancers make up the vast majority of cancers and, during the transition from benign adenoma to malignant carcinoma and metastatic dissemination, differentiated epithelial tumor cells acquire a de-differentiated, invasive phenotype accompanied by dramatic changes in cellular morphology, the loss and remodeling of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion and the gain of migratory and invasive capabilities. These changes are hallmarks of an Epithelial-Mesenchymal-Transition (EMT), a multistage process involving distinct genetic and epigenetic alterations and a high degree of cellular plasticity. Notably, during an EMT cells also acquire profound survival capabilities and are able to overcome cell death by apoptosis-inducing signals or by the loss of substrate adhesion (anoikis), to escape from immunosurveillance in the blood stream and even to resist to chemotherapy. Moreover, cancer cells undergoing an EMT exhibit hallmarks of cancer stem cells, such as increased growth as spheroids, colony formation in clonal growth assays and high tumorigenicity upon transplantation into mice. Thus, an EMT may be a principal mechanism for metastatic cancer cells to escape therapy and to continue to seed metastasis. These findings indicate that EMT is regulated on the level of both morphogenesis and cell survival, and propose a concept that cancer metastasis and drug resistance could be therapeutically targeted on the same level. While the contribution of an EMT to the development of therapy resistance has been previously demonstrated, the functional requirement of an EMT to metastasis formation is still highly debated. The vast majority of experimental data supports this notion, yet conclusive experiments demonstrating a causal relationship or using fate mapping of cancer cells that undergo an EMT during metastasis formation in vivo are still lacking. Here, we employ genetic fate mapping of cancer cells undergoing an EMT in a transgenic mouse model of metastatic breast cancer. Cancer cells that undergo an EMT will be visualized by a fluorescence color switch from red to green. They thus can be imaged in histological tumor sections and by live cell imaging in tumor slice cultures, and they can be isolated by flow cytometry for further genetic, transcriptomic and biochemical analysis. Furthermore, we will treat these mice with conventional chemotherapy and assess whether the number and localization of cancer cells undergoing an EMT will change. Subsequent isolation and molecular analysis will be performed to identify and validate the signaling pathways underlying EMT, therapy resistance and cancer stemness, three critical features of malignant tumor progression and metastasis.   In particular, we will address the following questions:   (1) Fate mapping of breast cancer cells undergoing an EMT: is an EMT involved in primary tumor invasion, in cancer cell intravasation and in lung metastasis?    (2) Are cancer cells undergoing an EMT more therapy-resistant in vivo?   From these experiments, we envisage not only to obtain critical new insights into the molecular regulation of malignant tumor progression and metastasis, but we also hope to open new avenues for the development of innovative therapeutic approaches to overcome cancer drug resistance and metastasis formation.  ","breast cancer, EMT, metastasis, lineage tracing",external_funding,Active,4141706,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,266,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

These farmers have little access to capital intensive technical equipment such as irrigation and mineral fertilizers to stabilize and increase their crop yields. As a consequence, smart and sustainable low input solutions are needed to stabilize and increase yields in dryland farming and to improve the livelihoods of small holder and subsistence farmers.Improving and stabilizing yields in dryland agriculture could come from designing sustainable agroecosystems that are built on in-depth ecological knowledge and that capitalize on beneficial plant-plant and plant-microbe interactions (Tscharntke et al., 2012; Brooker et al. 2014). One such sustainable low-input solution could be bioirrigation through intercropping (Liste and White, 2008; Burgess, 2011, Prieto et al., 2012). Bioirrigation is the result of an ecological interaction between two neighboring plants, where a deep-rooted plant supports the water supply and nutrient uptake of a neighbouring shallow-rooted plant.The concept of bioirrigation is linked to the ecohydrologically important process of hydraulic lift, where water from deep and wet soil layers is transported via the roots of plants to shallow and dry soil layers as a consequence of a soil water potential gradient (Dawson, 1993; Caldwell et al. 1998). Over the past three decades, hydraulic lift has been described to be performed by hundreds of plant species from different taxonomic groups and in various habitats. In contrast, very few studies were able to show that hydraulically lifted water from one species can effectively be utilized by another neighboring species. Bioirrigation has thus not yet been established as an ecological intercropping system that allows to stabilize and increase yields in marginal dryland farming (Burgess, 2011).Objective: The main objective of this project is to develop the ecological know-how that will allow to establish intercropping systems for dryland agriculture, where deep rooted legume species can effectively bioirrigate shallow rooted millets and increase as such the water relations, nutrient uptake and yields of these staple food crops of southern India and sub-Saharan Africa.",NA,external_funding,Active,4488758,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,267,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab for this indication has not previously been evaluated in Switzerland. MethodsWe conducted an analysis using a partitioned survival model with a cycle length of one week, basecase time horizon of 20 years and discount rate of 3% for cost and health outcomes. KEYNOTE-024 randomised controlled trial data of pembrolizumab monotherapy compared to chemotherapy was used as a basis for projecting time-on-treatment, progression-free survival and overall survival outcomes, over a 20 year period. For overall survival and progression-free survival, we used Kaplan-Meier probabilities for a brief initial period of the model, followed by parametric curves which had the best fit with subsequent trial data. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated based on the EuroQol 5-dimensional 3-level (EQ-5D-3L) questionnaire administered to trial patients. Costs (Swiss Franc (CHF), year 2018) of drug acquisition/administration, adverse events and disease management were included. ResultsFor the base-case, pembrolizumab monotherapy resulted in mean incremental costs of CHF 77,060 (pembrolizumab: CHF 223,324, chemotherapy: CHF 146,264) and mean incremental QALYs of 1.34 (pembrolizumab: 3.05, chemotherapy: 1.71), leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CHF 57,402 per QALY gained. Cost-effectiveness results were most sensitive to overall survival parameters and relatively insensitive to other parameters varied. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the probability of cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of CHF 100,000 per QALY gained, was 88%.

Its presence across disparate length scales (earthquakes, car engines down to molecular machines) reminds us of its ubiquity which endows friction of an utmost practical importance. Therefore, attempts to control it are almost as old as civilization. Interestingly, during the past decades we have witnessed a growing progress inminiaturization of devices down to the nanometer scale. ""Special problems occur when things get small [...] and it might turn out to be advantages if we knew how to design for them"", said Feynman when discussing the prospects of building ""infinitesimal machinery"". To achieve this goal, and to design efficient molecular nano-engines, it becomes imperative to know how friction at a molecular level can be controlled. In this project we propose to address this challenge by tuning molecular friction and adhesion via atomic/chemical design. Specifically, we shall study the lifting and sliding of two template molecules (porphyrin and terpyridine) over a Silver (111) surface. These molecules contain substituents groups that act as spinning molecular wheels when sliding over a surface. By proper modifications of these groups (wheels) we can tune the grip/drift response and the efficiency of the ball bearing over which the molecular wheel spins.

As Western European countries struggle to implement more sustainable forms of living, vast research is being conducted to study and inform these transitions processes. Sustainability transitions research has highlighted the role of actors from a variety of social spheres in promoting low carbon transitions. However, it has thus far ignored religion as a potentially important factor, despite the growing number of academic contributions in religious studies that underscore its role in promoting low carbon transitions. In particular, religion's impact on current low carbon transitions in cities remains largely unexplored. This research project addresses this research gap by studying how religion manifests itself in urban low carbon transition processes. The research project combines insights from (a) sustainability transition studies, (b) sociological theory, and (c) contributions to the debate on religion and ecology, to evolve a framework for the study of religion in low carbon transitions. This framework identifies two ways in which religion may become manifest in urban low carbon transitions: (a) religious actors (e.g. Christian churches) acting as ""service providers"" for low carbon transitions, contributing to these processes with specific functions (i.e. public lobbying, materialization of transitions, environmental value dissemination); and (b) ""non-religious"" actors involved in low carbon transitions employing religion in their communication (e.g. politicians referring to the sacredness of nature). Accordingly, the proposed research will focus on two potential manifestations of religion in urban low carbon transitions: (a) contributions from religious actors to these transitions, (b) religion manifesting itself in the environmental engagement of ""non-religious"" actors. Focusing on these two types of actors, the project will undertake research in two benchmark cities with multiple research methods, including qualitative interviews, analysis of document material, and participative observation.

Daniel Bernoulli's (1738) expected utility theory paved the way for important concepts and measurements of utility and risk in economics and psychology. Regrettably, Bernoulli's emphasis on the importance of individual circumstances and characteristics has received little attention in these fields, with the orthodox view in economics being to ignore differences in preferences ""among men and periods"" (Stigler &amp; Becker, 1977). Importantly, even recent approaches of behavioral economics and finance that depart from rational views on human decision-making do not fully acknowledge the importance of inter- and intra-individual differences that can lead to thriving or withering in the financial marketplace (Akerlof &amp; Shiller, 2009; Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979). In this project, we aim to fill this gap by investigating the cognitive and motivational origins of individual differences in financial decision-making and evaluate their relative contribution to successful real-world financial choices. We aim to adopt an interdisciplinary approach by linking insights from cognitive psychology, decision neuroscience, behavioral finance, and developmental psychology to pursue several important goals: First, building upon and going beyond recent research we will access individual variation in financial decision-making using a collection of different behavioral paradigms and measurement tools, including investment behavior at laboratory asset markets that identify and isolate crucial investment phenomena that are hypothesized to underlie real investment situations. Second, we will contribute to decomposing the sources of variation in decision making through cognitive modeling and neuroimaging techniques designed to uncover basic cognitive and motivational processes. Third, using field studies we will assess the relative contribution of specific cognitive and motivational processes to individual and age differences in real-world financial choices. Overall, the project promises a deeper insight into individual variation in financial decision-making and, ultimately, the development of personalized intervention programs that can improve individual financial decisions.",NA,external_funding,Active,4058236,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,277,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"Hamburger, Matthias","Potterat, Olivier",Departement Pharmazeutische Wissenschaften / Pharmazeutische Biologie (Hamburger),Herbal safety in the pregnancy - Treatment options for nonpsychotic mental diseases,2018,"Pregnancy is a critical period for medical care, well-being of both the woman and the embryo/foetus are to be considered. This is particularly relevant in the management of nonpsychotic mental disorders (NMD), since treatment with CNS-active drugs, but also untreated NMD may have negative effects. Some herbal preparations (phytopharmaceuticals) possess sedative, anxiolytic, or antidepressant properties. Since these preparations are often perceived as safe, their consumption during pregnancy might be high even though only a few studies have been conducted. Assessment of safety issues with phytopharmaceuticals is highly challenging.  The active ingredients are multi-component mixtures of compounds, many of which undergo metabolisation by the intestinal microbiota upon oral administration, and metabolisation in the liver once reaching systemic blood circulation. Moreover, some of these compounds might be toxic and reach the embryo/foetus via the placenta. The project strives for characterising the safety of commonly used herbal medications for the treatment of NMD during pregnancy. Well-known herbal medications for these diseases are valerian, hops, golden poppy, lavender, and St. John's wort. Major aims of the project are: (1) characterisation of the use of herbal preparations during pregnancy, (2) analyses of their metabolisation by the intestinal flora and in the liver; (3) assessment of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in vitro of these extracts and of critical compounds in extracts before and after metabolisation; (4) characterisation of intestinal absorption of the various compounds; (5) prediction of their hormone-disrupting effects and possible drug interactions; (6) assessment of effects on the function of immunocompetent cells and; (7) of placenta cell cultures; (8) investigation of their permeation across the placenta barrier. Whether the herbal preparations are commonly being used during pregnancy will be addressed with a survey in aim 1 (Zurich/A.P. Simões-Wüst, in collaboration with M. Puhan). To accomplish aim 2, the chemical composition of herbal preparations will be characterised before and after being metabolised by intestinal flora and liver microsomes (Basel/M. Hamburger, O. Potterat, in collaboration with C. Lacroix). Extracts and compounds (unmetabolised and metabolised) will be then submitted to cytotoxicity and genotoxicity assessment, in comparison with two synthetic CNS-active drugs that are frequently given during pregnancy, namely diazepam  and citalopram. Cytotoxicity and genotoxicity will be tested in sensitive immunocompetent cells and in a placenta cell line (Freiburg/C. Gründemann). Hormone disruptive effects and possible drug interactions will be assessed in silico (Basel/M. Hamburger, O. Potterat, in collaboration with M. Smieko).  Further experiments should clarify the impact of the herbal preparations on functional properties of immunocompetent cells (Freiburg/C. Gründemann), and of placenta cells (gene expression, Zurich/A.P. Simões-Wüst). At the same time, permeation across the placenta barrier will be assessed in a transwell model, and effects on functional properties in a placenta perfusion system (Zurich/A.P. Simões-Wüst, analytical support in Basel/M. Hamburger, O. Potterat). Knowing whether herbal preparations can be considered safe for use during pregnancy will provide a rational basis for decisions on the treatment of NMD during pregnancy. Taking into account the intestinal and hepatic metabolism is an entirely novel approach in the risk assessment of phytopharmaceuticals.

Today, in urological out- and inpatients, multidrug-resistance among main uropathogens such as Escherichia coli is increasing rapidly - which can, at least partly, be explained by the well-characterised extended use and over-prescription of antibiotics in daily urological practice, especially for antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) in standard urological procedures. A prolonged course of AP decreases the rate of bacteriuria at the expense of higher rates of adverse drug events, Clostridium difficile-associated infections and consecutive antimicrobial resistances.Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is one of the most frequently performed urological procedures, which is conducted in almost 10,000 men annually in Switzerland. However, photoselective vaporisation with the Greenlight Laser (GL) has become an important alternative to TURP, particularly in patients receiving anticoagulation therapy. Generally, urine is sterile, but TURP and GL are performed in an elderly population, where asymptomatic bacteriuria is highly prevalent; therefore, TURP belongs to the category ""clean-contaminated"" according to the World Health Organisation and consequently, routine AP in TURP is considered as a standard of care. The European Association of Urology and our in-house guidelines recommend routine AP in TURP to decrease the incidence of bacteriuria, bacteraemia, and urinary tract infections (UTIs). But currently, there are no randomised controlled trials and guidelines for AP in patients undergoing GL. In addition, most of the studies for AP in TURP were performed more than twenty years ago - with still a large gap being present between actual clinical practice of AP in TURP and evidence-based guidelines especially in terms of duration of AP. Therefore, we aim to compare the effectiveness of the current clinical practice (usual care with prolonged AP) to guideline-conform single-shot AP with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in patients undergoing TURP and GL. For this purpose, we will conduct a multicentre pragmatic randomised controlled trial analysing the non-inferiority of a single-dose AP on the primary outcome measure of postoperative UTI and urosepsis within 30 days after TURP and GL.

Among the most successful tools are magnetic force microscopy (MFM), spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy, as well as scanning magnetometers based on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, Hall-bars, and superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). Here, we propose the development and application of two particularly promising scanning probe techniques. The first is scanning SQUID microscopy, which - in its most advanced form - achieves record sensitivity to both stray magnetic flux and local thermal dissipation. Recently, it has been used to study the dynamics of superconducting vortices and to map nanometer-scale transport. In order to extend its applicability and optimize its functionality, we aim to realize a nanometer-scale SQUID integrated on an atomic force microscopy (AFM) tip, producing a hybrid AFM-SQUID sensitive to surface forces, stray magnetic flux, and local temperature. The second is based on newly developed nanowire (NW) force sensors, which have recently enabled a form of AFM capable of mapping both the size and direction of tip-sample forces. Using NWs functionalized with magnetic tips, we intend to realize a form of vectorial MFM capable of mapping stray magnetic fields with enhanced sensitivity and resolution compared to the state of the art. The unique capabilities of these two scanning probes will provide new types of imaging contrast for nanometer-scale magnetic structures such as domain walls, magnetic vortices, and magnetic skyrmions, whose equilibrium configurations and dynamical properties are crucial for both fundamental understanding and spintronic applications. In addition to studying magnetic nanostructures and spin-dependent phenomena, we will apply our newly developed techniques to the study of mesoscopic current flow in topological insulators and two-dimensional materials.

"Eckert, Anne",NA,Bereich Psychiatrie (Klinik); Bereich Psychiatrie (Klinik) / Erwachsenenpsychiatrie UPK,Cellular aging in-a-dish: Impact of stress,2018,"Aging is a risk factor for several of the world's most prevalent diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders. However, while much research has focused on age-related neurodegenerative disorders broadening our understanding of the underlying disease-specific molecular pathways, significantly fewer studies investigated the molecular biology of the aging brain in the absence of disease. Practical tools for studying brain aging encompass many model organisms. Since mouse models have some limitations regarding transferability to human physiology and lifespan, advanced human in vitro models are wanted. The fact that live human brain samples, such as neurons, are not as accessible slowed down progress in the field. The recent advent of technologies that enable adult human somatic cells to be reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for the generation of neural cells as well as direct conversion into neural cells (induced neurons, iNs) has therefore provided a unique opportunity to investigate important aspects of CNS function in vitro. In contrast to iPSCs derived neurons, directly programmed iNs generated from aged donors' fibroblasts retain age-associated transcriptional signatures of the donor population and exhibit functional deficits in their capacity to properly compartmentalize nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins (Mertens et al., 2016, Mertens et al., 2015) suggesting that direct cell fate conversion bypassing pluripotency allows the identification of processes associated with aging and the modeling of human aging on a cellular level. However, many aging aspects were not yet investigated in this iNs model. Different hallmarks are generally considered to contribute to the aging process, e.g. mitochondrial failure, genomic instability, and telomere attrition. Together they determine the aging phenotype.   The goal of the present proposal is therefore to further characterize and validate this advanced human neural in vitro model of aging by investigating six important age-related candidate features: i) in the first place we focus on mitochondrial dysfunction as a central player in the aging process, where many age-associated impairments converge on with a negative impact; ii) genome instability, iii) telomere attrition, iv) epigenetic alterations, v) loss of proteostasis, and vi) cellular senescence;   in three different aging models: a) the classic cell model of normal human fibroblasts (NHFs) from healthy young and aged donors, b) the advanced cell model of human induced neurons (iNs) from the corresponding young and aged donor fibroblasts, c) neuronal aging in the mouse brain (the Thy1-mitoCFP mouse model expressing the cyan fluorescent protein only in neuronal mitochondria, especially in the hippocampus, allows the comprehensive analysis of age-related changes in mitochondrial morphology and dynamics).   Thus the study will address the following questions:  Do iNs retain important aging-related signatures besides the donor-age dependent transcriptomic signature demonstrated by Mertens et al. (2015)? Are stress approaches effective in mimicking cellular aging in iNs? Are the aging signatures of iNs relevant for the aging brain?    Our study will increase our understanding of how well ''aged'' iNs are representative of human aging by modeling the aging process in vitro.

"Hall, Michael N.",NA,Departement Biozentrum / Biochemistry (Hall),mTOR signaling in growth and metabolism (BoE),2018,"TOR (target of rapamycin) is a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase that controls cell growth and metabolism in response to nutrients, growth factors, and cellular energy. TOR was originally discovered in budding yeast but is conserved in all eukaryotes including plants, worms, flies, and mammals. The discovery of TOR led to a fundamental change in how one thinks of cell growth. It is not a spontaneous process that just happens when building blocks (nutrients) are available, but rather a highly regulated, plastic process controlled by TOR-dependent signaling pathways. TOR is found in two structurally and functionally distinct multi-protein complexes, TORC1 and TORC2, each regulating its own set of downstream effector pathways. The two TOR complexes, like TOR itself, are highly conserved. The two TORCs mediate cell growth and metabolism by activating and inhibiting several anabolic and catabolic processes, respectively. The processes regulated by TORC1 and TORC2 include ribosome biogenesis, translation, transcription, lipid and nucleotide synthesis, nutrient transport, and autophagy. Thus, the two TOR complexes constitute an ancestral signaling network conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution to control the fundamental process of cell growth. While the role of TOR in controlling growth of single cells is relatively well understood, a major challenge now is to understand the role of TOR signaling in coordinating and integrating overall body growth and metabolism in multi-cellular organisms. This will require elucidating the role of TOR signaling in individual tissues. As a continuation of our current SNSF grant and our longstanding interest in TOR, a goal of our research for the next three years is to continue the characterization of the non-cell autonomous function of mammalian TOR (mTOR) signaling in metabolic tissues in the mouse. More specifically, how does mTOR signaling in adipose tissue and the adrenal cortex control whole body physiology? The major specific aims are 1) to identify an mTORC2-regulated adipokine that improves â cell function, and 2) to investigate the role of mTORC1 signaling in adrenal steroid hormone production. In addition to these non-cell autonomous functions of mTOR signaling, will also continue to study cell autonomous function of mTOR. The major specific aims of this part of our proposed research are 3) to characterize oncogenic mTOR signaling in the liver, and 4) to study the role of mTOR in regulating RNA-binding proteins. As a central controller of cell growth and metabolism, mTOR plays a key role in development and aging, and is implicated in disorders such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes.

"von Fumetti, Stefanie",NA,Departement Umweltwissenschaften / Biogeographie (Nagel),Adaptation or isolation: Disenthralling the myth of crenobiosis of spring-dwelling invertebrates,2018,"Natural springs are endangered ecotones that are very sensitive to anthropogenic impacts. They are isolated island-like habitats at the beginning of headwaters, which hampers colonisation. The relatively stable abiotic conditions - mainly thermal stability - in springs was for long seen as the reason for the restriction of species to springs and cold-stenothermy was the main argument for the exclusive occurrence of species in springs - for crenobiosis. The general goal of our research is to understand the nature of crenobiosis. Are species really bound to springs due to their adaptation to stable abiotic conditions? Are species inhabiting springs isolated relicts of a formerly widely distributed cold-water adapted fauna? To answer these fundamental questions of spring ecology that are also important for conservation strategies we will look at individual species traits and phylogeographic aspects. Our proposal is divided into three parts processing the research questions with different methodological approaches: 1. Reaction of species described as spring specialists to changes in temperature under controlled laboratory conditions in flow channels: What are the effects of temperature increase and increased temperature variability on the fitness of individuals? 2. Isolation of individuals of spring species using molecular genetic analyses: how isolated are populations of different springs from each other a) in a historical biogeographical perspective linked with Pleistocene refugia and b) in a recent perspective linked with conservation aspects. 3. Isolation of spring taxa on metacommunity level along a longitudinal geographical gradient: Is the faunistic change along the gradient correlated with the geographic distance or are environmental parameters more important? Our model organisms in part 1 and 2 will be species described as spring specialists in literature. We will choose an active disperser, namely Crunoecia irrorata, and a passively dispersing water mite, Partnunia steinmanni. In part 3 we will take Hydrachnidia and Trichoptera as model groups. The combination of three methodological approaches and three dispersal modes will allow a rigorous disentangling of crenobiosis.

It exacts an enormous cost in economic and human terms. Timely diagnosis is crucial for the outcome of therapy and health care associated costs. However, the high morbidity and mortality of pneumonia is partly due to the lack of efficient diagnostics. Animals with an excellent sense of smell (e.g. dogs) are capable of identifying bacterial infections by sniffing out sputum samples or even the air surrounding the infected patient. We thus hypothesize that pneumonia caused by bacterial agents can be identified by analyzing characteristic volatile metabolites produced during infection in the lung, which are eventually exhaled in breath. The goal of this project is to rapidly (within 15 min) diagnose bacterial pneumonia using a breath test. Additionally, the test should be capable to identify a subset of responsible pathogens. We will deploy an innovative mass spectrometric breath analysis technique (secondary electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry; SESI-MS) in a clinical setting. SESI-MS combines real-time response and unparalleled sensitivity (parts-per-trillion) and selectivity (~300 compounds per breath sample). We hypothesize that such a comprehensive metabolic fingerprint will provide an accurate pathogen-specific signature. We will combine cutting-edge analytical techniques, bioinformatics, mice models and access to well characterized patients in a multidisciplinary approach to elucidate and quantify exhaled metabolites that are indicators of pneumonia. This will significantly improve the current clinical and epidemiological situation by: i) enabling pathogen-based antibiotic treatment (thus reducing antibiotic resistance); ii) improving patients' outcome; iii) saving costs by supporting evidence-based hospitalization/outpatient decisions and iv) identifying altered metabolic routes, thus gaining insights on the mechanisms by which pathogens circumvent the human immune system.",Disease diagnosis; Pneumonia; Breath analysis; Lung infectious diseases; Mass spectrometry,external_funding,Active,4285284,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,284,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Human Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) initiation and relapse are thought to be mediated by leukaemic stem cells (LSCs), defined by their ability to initiate leukaemia in immunodeficient mice. To induce disease, LSCs must also escape immunosurveillance. Links between human LSCs and immune evasion are not accounted for by experimental paradigms using immunocompro-mised animals, and thus remain largely unexplored. Here we hypothesize that immune evasion and stemness are closely intertwined in human AML. We analyzed 175 primary AML samples and found that ligands of the danger de-tector NKG2D (NKG2DL), a critical mediator of anti-tumour immunity by cytotoxic lymphocytes including natural killer (NK) cells, are heterogeneously expressed on leukemic blasts from individual patients. Intra-patient comparisons between NKG2DL positive (NKG2DLpos) and negative (NKG2DLneg) subpopulations indicate that NKG2DLneg AML cells selectively escape NK cell killing in vitro and in NOD/SCID/IL2R?null (NSG) mice co-transplanted with NK cells. Furthermore, NKG2DLneg AML cells LSCs display stem cell characteristics such as immature morphology, stemness-associated gene expression signatures, enhanced in vitro clonogenicity and unique ability to initiate leukaemia in NSG mice. When compared to NKG2DLpos AML cells of the same patient, NKG2DLneg LSCs show differential expression of several other inflammatory response genes, providing further evidence for their distinct interaction with the immune system. In particular, NKG2DLneg AML LSCs show enriched expression of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1), and PARP1 inhibition using an inhibitory drug or PARP1 siRNAs selectively induces NKG2DL expression on CD34+ LSCs. The current proposal follows up on these results and addresses following aims:Aim 1: Investigation of PARP1 inhibition for in vivo sensitization of LSCs to NK cell attack in human AML xenograftsAim 2: Exploration of the effects of PARP1 inhibition on NKG2DL expression in healthy hematopoietic cells Aim 3: Mechanistic investigation of NKG2DL expression suppression in LSCsAim 4: Analysis of absence of NKG2DL expression for LSC enrichment in conjunction with other LSC markers Significance: These data provide a conceptual frame-work for the integration of two central hypotheses of cancer development - the concepts of cancer stem cells and immune escape. Furthermore, they point out detection of absence of NKG2DL expression as a method that can enriches AML LSCs. Stemness-associated immune escape might represent a novel biological principle that extends to other cancers, and perhaps even healthy tissues, which opens up exciting new research avenues. The results of this study are also important from a translational point of view: adoptive NK cell transfer is currently being tested in more than hundred registered clinical trials for treatment of AML (see https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=Acute+Myeloid+Leukemia&amp;term=NK&amp;cntry1).

Their replacement by more earth-abundant metals is of long-standing interest, and the first half of this proposed research project aims to explore the possibility of obtaining fundamentally new luminescent and photoredox-active complexes with long-lived excited-states. The plan is to synthesize and investigate a broad range of metal complexes made from earth-abundant metals in various oxidation states that until now have received either extremely limited or no attention at all in photophysical and photochemical contexts. Specifically, it is planned to explore: (i) homoleptic d6 MLCT luminophores and photoredox catalysts made from Cr(0), Mn(I), or Mo(0) with novel chelating isocyanide ligands, (ii) heteroleptic d10 MLCT emitters made from Ni(0) and a combination of chelating diphosphine and diisocyanide ligands, (iii) d-d emitters based on six-coordinate V(II) or Mn(IV) (d3) complexes, (iv) d0 LMCT luminophores based on Ti(IV) or Zr(IV) with chelating ligands made from pyrrolic and phenolic binding units.While the focus of this project is on obtaining fundamental insight into the basic photophysics and photochemistry of these new metal complexes, the development of such compounds made from earth-abundant elements is of significant interest in the contexts of lighting devices, solar cells, sensors, photoredox catalysis in organic chemistry, or for sensitization of reactions leading to the conversion of (solar) light into chemically stored energy, i. e., for so-called solar fuels.The second half of this proposed project aims at gaining fundamental insight into multi-photon, multi-electron transfer reactions going conceptually far beyond traditional work on photoinduced single electron transfer in donor-acceptor compounds. Artificial photosynthesis will have to rely on multi-electron conversions such as water splitting and CO2 reduction, but currently many studies use sacrificial redox reagents to perform such reactions under irradiation with visible light.

"Lucek, Kay","Augustijnen, Hannah",Departement Umweltwissenschaften / Pflanzenökologie und -evolution (Willi),Genomic rearrangements and the origin of species,2018,"Background: As we witness the sixth mass extinction, it is increasingly pressing to understand the mechanisms that underlie the emergence and maintenance of species. The evolution of reproductive isolation is the foremost requirement for speciation, and barriers that reduce interspecific gene flow are key to maintain species boundaries. Large-scale rearrangements through chromosomal fusion and fission have been suggested to represent such barriers. However, their importance and impact on the rate of speciation are not understood. This project sets to unravel the role of chromosomal fusion and fission during the process of speciation both on a micro- and macroevolutionary level within a single genus. Combining phylogenomic and population genomic approaches, my project will provide an unprecedented picture on the impact of large-scale chromosomal rearrangements for the emergence and maintenance of biodiversity, advancing the field of speciation research.Hypotheses: My project addresses three key hypotheses that have not been empirically tested in an integrative manner: i) Chromosomal fusion and fission accelerate the rate of speciation. ii) Large-scale chromosomal changes through fusion and fission between sister species represent intrinsic barriers, i.e. constrain interspecific gene flow and hybridization. iii) Reinforcement maintains species boundaries in the absence of genomic rearrangements. Procedure: The study system is Erebia - the most species rich Palearctic butterfly genus - whose cold-adapted species are yet threatened by climate change. Its recent radiation across Europe has been attributed to rapid changes in chromosome numbers but not formally tested. Using genome-based data and phylogenetic comparative methods, I will first assess the macroevolutionary impact of differing chromosome numbers as a result of fusion and fission on the rate of speciation. I will then identify the microevolutionary processes at play between three sister species of the recently evolved Erebia tyndarus species complex, where species differ in their number of chromosomes or not. Based on population genomic data from within and outside the known contact zones, I will assess the levels and locations of interspecific gene flow along the genome as well as the genomic footprint of intrinsic barriers as represented by differing chromosome numbers. Finally, I will evaluate the role of reinforcement driving interspecific differentiation and gene flow, combining genomic with phenotypic and ecological cline analyses. Many hundred specimens were already collected and are available for immediate analysis, and interspecific contact zones have been identified.Importance: Integrating micro- and macroevolution, this project provides unparalleled insights into the genomic mechanisms that promote speciation and therefore the emergence and maintenance of biodiversity. The results will resolve the role of large-scale genomic architectural changes acting as intrinsic barriers to gene flow and significantly advance the recently emerged field of speciation genomics. Being adapted to high elevation environments, Erebia will face severe ecological alterations in the near future as a result of climate change. This work will thus give novel insights into the evolutionary mechanisms at play in a species group that is threatened by climate change, making Erebia a model system for many similarly threatened species in the Alps. The results allow establishing a general evolutionary framework, enabling to predict the genomic fate of Alpine species and thus provide a basis for future policy implementations of national and international stakeholders.",NA,external_funding,Active,4500647,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,289,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Unfortunately, most research with family caregivers concentrates on quality of life, providing concrete knowledge and information, training home care and management skills. Focus upon boosting resilience in caregivers is nowadays enhanced as compared to research interest over the last few years. For the support made available to the family caregivers to be effective and efficient, all of their support needs (informational, practical, ethical, emotional) should be known, which will be crucial in reducing the caregiving burden felt by many family caregivers. Besides ongoing research in Ireland and the Netherlands on needs of informal caregivers of patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), there are hardly any studies or systematic data on the perception of family caregivers of ALS patients regarding their palliative care situation at home. Suggestions for improvement from their perspectives is much needed so that both the ALS patient and the family caregivers are supported during the care process in the best possible way. Doing so is productive not only for the affected family members but also for the overall care system.   Research on the needs of ALS family caregivers have received very little attention in Switzerland. This is saddening in light of the national initiatives to learn about end-of-life care and palliative care. Despite promising genetic discoveries, this chronic neuromuscular disorder is terminal. ALS is progressive and may be rather rare, whereas for palliative care it possesses model qualities. That is, ALS palliative patients highlight a rich pattern of basic questions raised by different patient groups that need palliative care, such as breaking the (unexpected) news, how to support a terminally ill person, the need to always stay a step ahead of the illness, advance care planning, and including family members in shared decision-making. But they are unique because of the speed of the illness that results in a rapid sequence of essential bodily functions such as mobility, speaking, swallowing and breathing, which asks for adaptation to the changes in a very short time.   Using the example of the disease course in ALS, this project aims at improving the palliative care situation of patients by exploring the complex needs of family caregivers und how they can be best supported, so that the person with ALS can determine his or her end-of-life circumstances. In terms of possible palliative support in home care situations, the needs, benefits, and conditions of ethics consultation by a mobile palliative care team will be assessed from the perspective of the different professional and informal actors that enable palliative care at home. The project will be use qualitative methodology. Semi-structured interviews will be carried out with two types of ALS family members (total n=40): those who have provided care to an ALS patient in the past and those who are currently providing care to an ALS patient. Family members could be spouse, partner or adult children. Focus group interviews (n = 8; in each focus group there will be at least 4 participants) will be carried out with nurses providing home care (Spitex); and GPs and palliative care physicians. All participants will be recruited from St. Gallen and the Basel regions because we already have good collaborations with teams in these two regions. The results of this study will be analysed using qualitative analysis followed by data triangulation between the two data sources (family caregivers and professional carers) and in-depth discussions of our findings with professionals working in the field using planned analysis workshops. As an exploratory study of its nature, we will unfortunately not be able to gather data from the French speaking region of the country, but the results should be useful to all families in similar situation nationwide.

The Instrumentalization of Admiration, Astonishment and Surprise in Discourses of Knowledge, Power and Art",2018,"This sinergia-project, directed by Mireille Schnyder (Zürich, Leading House) and Nicola Gess, aims to provide groundbreaking insights into the social relevance of aesthetic emotions, by showing that the analysis of the deliberate instrumentalization of wonder (Staunen) in political, scientific, social and artistic contexts casts an innovative light onto the structuring of cultural values, the ordering of knowledge and our practices of governance and domination. Further members of the project are Hugues Marchal (Basel) and Ulrich Bröckling (Freiburg i.Br.). The sinergia-project builds upon the results of a previous Sinergia project, Poetics and Aesthetics of Amazement. As indicated in its title, that first phase of research focused on the fabrication, reflection and function of wonder within literature and the arts, with a significant attention to philosophical thought. However, the new project endeavors to research how these practices and the kinds of wonder they induce are used in the fields of power and knowledge. If aesthetics, rhetoric and poetics investigate and conceptualize the artificial production of wonder in the threefold sense of admiration, astonishment and surprise, these closely related emotions are also put in operation in a much broader range of human activities. They are commonly sought, managed and questioned in, for example, politics, pedagogy and education, polemology, ecological and security issues, (popular) science, advertising and media, when issues of hierarchy, legitimacy and risk assessment, but also persuasion, manipulation and entertainment are at stake. The project aims to study these instrumentalizations of wonder and to assess their massive cultural importance in a strongly interdisciplinary perspective that primarily joins cultural sociology and literary studies, as well as the history of science, but that will also rely on the collaboration of scholars of educational science, history, art and architecture, musicology, and security studies, who are involved in supervising the doctoral candidates. That said, our methodology is based on the hypothesis that literature, literary studies and the sociological approach of cultural analysis are key tools to understand processes in which wonder is instrumentalized. Literature has not only reflected on its own fabrication and use of this affect; it has also constantly depicted, analyzed and/or criticized the broader social and anthropological utilization of wonder that we want to study, and it therefore forms a rich diachronic archive of relevant observations and assumptions. Non-literary strategies of inducing and appropriating wonder heavily rely on linguistic, discursive and aesthetic tools: their analysis therefore calls for instruments of literary studies, such as rhetoric, poetics, aesthetics, that are to be applied to a meta-analysis of public discourses of knowledge and power, their practices and arrangement in the public sphere. Finally, the sociological approach of cultural analysis allows us to research wonder as a specific form of elicited and orchestrated interpersonal behavior. Historically, the project focuses on early modern and modern history and contemporary times. This time frame, ranging from 1600 to the present, allows for examining important discursive and historical shifts, which we consider to be crucial for the topic at hand.  ",NA,external_funding,Active,4076994,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,296,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Despite significant progress in MS diagnosis and treatment, there remains the need to understand what drives this disease and its clinical progression. Specifically, it is essential to define the interplay between axonal damage - encompassing axonal demyelination, degeneration, loss and disorganization - and axonal repair - namely axonal remyelination and reorganization, which ultimately influence MS evolution and the accrual of disability.Clinical MS categories are quite heterogeneous. Nevertheless, pathology studies have identified some characteristic traits in early-stage patients with active MS (aMS) and in non-active progressive MS patients (naPMS). Early-stage aMS patients - who are subjects with clinical and/or radiological signs of on-going inflammation - exhibit neuropathological signs of substantial acute axonal damage and significant remyelination. On the other end, naPMS patients - who are subjects with clinical deterioration and no clinical or radiological evidence of disease activity - show less acute axonal damage and remyelination but extensive axonal loss. These characteristic neuropathologic traits of aMS and naPMS patients have not yet been demonstrated in living MS patients. The in vivo quantification of axonal damage and repair in MS patients is essential (i) to gain knowledge on MS pathogenesis and its clinical progression as well as (ii) to understand and quantify the effects of current and future neuroprotective and regenerative therapies. To this end, INsIDER will combine advanced MRI techniques sensitive to axonal structure and organization to gain new insights into axonal damage and repair in MS. In fact, MRI metrics derived from models based on diffusion MRI, Magnetization Transfer Imaging, Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping, Myelin Imaging and T1 relaxometry provide complementary and partially redundant information about the axonal structure and axonal organization. Therefore, their combination may increase the sensitivity and specificity to axonal pathology and axonal changes over time.Through classical and modern machine-learning analysis of multiple advanced MRI data combined with demographic and genetic information, INsIDER will quantify in vivo the differences between aMS and non-active progressive MS (naPMS) patients. Furthermore, INsIDER will validate the most discriminative imaging metrics between aMS and naPMS patients with post-mortem measures of axonal damage and remyelination. The specific aims for this proposal are: Aim 1. Quantify differences in axonal integrity and organization in aMS vs naPMS patients. Aim 2. Quantify changes in axonal integrity and organization in aMS vs naPMS patients over a two-year period. Aim 3.

"Hutter, Gregor",NA,Faculty of Medicine; Departement Biomedizin; Bereich Operative Fächer (Klinik),Combined Microglia Modulation and Tumor Targeting Against Glioblastoma,2018,"Background. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a fatal brain tumor that is resistant to all treatments. Besides other non-neoplastic stromal cells, the tumor microenvironment (TME) of GBM consists of a large, dynamic compartment of immune system related cells. Main players of the immune TME (iTME) are tumor infiltrating brain-resident microglia, macrophages (Mf), and T-lymphocytes. GBMs are capable of subverting the iTME to facilitate their own growth by re-educating it for their own purposes. Therefore, instead of targeting the tumor cells directly, modulation of the iTME is likely to be a promising approach to combat the disease. Multiple strategies that target either adaptive or innate compartments of the iTME are currently being evaluated. Preliminary data. Previously, we designed a novel orthotopic patient-derived xenograft mouse model with genetically color-coded Mf and microglia, and modulated tumor-associated Mf and microglia (termed tumor-associated macrophages, TAMs) of the GBM-iTME by pharmacological means. The blockade of the ""don't eat me"" signal CD47 on tumor cells with anti-CD47 antibodies in vivo prompted both Mf- and microglia-induced phagocytosis. Moreover, it led to morphological changes in microglia, detectable with cranial in vivo imaging. The efficacy of anti-CD47 treatment was preserved in mice lacking Ccr2, limiting Mf&#61472;recruitment to the brain. Anti-CD47-induced GBM phagocytosis by microglia was sufficient to lessen the tumor burden significantly. Under anti-CD47 treatment, Mf&#61472;changed their transcriptional profile towards a pro-inflammatory, M1-polarized signature, whereas microglia displayed a loss of M2 genes. Thus, microglia are a potential target of innate iTME modulation in GBM. Hypothesis and research aims. The interplay between the adaptive immune system and microglia in the setting of innate immune modulation has not been studied thus far. Based on the results of our previous research, we hypothesize that microglia modulation can enhance an adaptive immune response. To test this, we propose to determine the response of the adaptive immune system in GBM after genetic or local pharmacological microglia modulation in vivo. Further, we hypothesize that immunotherapeutic interventions in GBM are insufficient if delivered as systemic monotherapies, because of tumor-cell heterogeneity, the immunosuppressive iTME, and the obstacle of the blood brain barrier. To optimize this, we propose to combine local microglia modulation with systemic T-cell checkpoint inhibitors to achieve therapeutic synergy. Strategies to specifically target GBM neoplastic cells, e.g. with signaling pathway inhibitors, have failed for similar reasons. Therefore, we hypothesize that local reprogramming of microglia within the GBM-iTME facilitates the action of tumor-specific strategies. Among others, EGFRvIII is a promising tumor antigen currently used as a target in clinical trials. Thus, we propose to combine local anti-CD47 mediated microglia modulation with intratumoral EGFRvIII-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell application to induce better tumor control. GBM tumor cells display a vast regional heterogeneity. However, the phenotypical differences of tumor-associated microglia in human GBM are unknown. We hypothesize that intratumoral microglia exhibit a region-specific functional heterogeneity, influenced by paracrine crosstalk with the tumor cells. This is especially important at the invasion zone of the tumor, where tumor recurrence prevails. To assess this microglial heterogeneity, we aim to characterize the region-specific phenotype of tumor-associated microglia in defined locations of resected GBM tissue obtained from a mouse model, and from human patients.","Glioblastoma, Immunotherapy, Innate Immmune System, Experimental Neurooncology",external_funding,Active,4348824,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,298,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Thus, it is crucial to elucidate the mechanisms underlying ER-redox control and identify involved modulators and biological reactions. The NAD(P)H/NAD(P)+ redox couple is essential for many biological functions and, in contrast to the cytoplasm, its regulation in the ER and the relevance of luminal NADPH for physiological functions such as intracellular calcium signaling, UPR control, and the metabolism of glucose, fatty acids, oxysterols, and glucocorticoids is insufficiently understood. The discovery of hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PDH) revealed a mechanism for luminal NADPH generation and provided a link between energy status and glucocorticoid signaling. To date, 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11b-HSD1) is still the only well characterized NADPH-dependent luminal enzyme. Besides its well-known role in glucocorticoid activation and involvement in metabolic and inflammatory diseases, increasing evidence revealed a role of 11b-HSD1 in oxysterol and bile acid metabolism, warranting further studies. Moreover, there must be other NADPH-dependent enzymes because 11b-HSD1 cannot account for the myopathy and increased susceptibility of hepatocytes toward toxicants observed in situations of H6PDH-deficiency. Based on previous results, we hypothesize that 1) the ratios of certain bile acids serve as potential prognostic markers for decreased 11b-HSD1 activity in rodents and human, 2) 11b-HSD1 is involved in the formation of dihydroxylated oxysterols that modulate the activities of nuclear receptors (ROR, ER&#946;, LXR&#946;) and the G-coupled receptor EBI2, 3) H6PDH delivers NADPH for fatty acid elongation in the ER, which is needed for rapid cell proliferation, 4) loss of H6PDH affects UPR and renders cells susceptible to substances causing ER-stress, and 5) other enzymes generating and utilizing NADPH in the ER exist and need to be identified and characterized. To study the consequences of ER NADPH depletion on hormonal and metabolic functions, and to identify and characterize novel modulators of luminal NADPH, we propose to:  evaluate whether ratios of certain 7oxo to 7&#946;-hydroxy bile acids in plasma/serum can serve as markers for reduced 11b-HSD1 activity in human, further explore the role of 11b-HSD1 in oxysterol and bile acid metabolism and the modulation of cognate receptors, study other enzymes generating or utilizing NADPH in the ER, study the impact of H6PDH on fatty acid synthesis/metabolism, investigate the impact of H6PDH on breast cancer cell properties, study the susceptibility of H6PDH-deficient primary liver and kidney cells to ER-stress, and explore the use of IP-MS and BioID to investigate protein-protein interactions in the ER.  Steroids and other lipophilic compounds in different matrices will be quantified using LC-MS/MS. The role of luminal NADPH and consequences of its depletion on metabolic and hormonal responses will be studied using enzyme preparations, cell-based models upon modulating the corresponding enzyme(s) by overexpression, downregulation by siRNA or pharmacological inhibition. Further, studies in transgenic mice and mice treated with inhibitors and in primary cells will be performed. Also, protein interaction methods will be employed, attempting to identify novel players in ER NADPH regulation. The proposed research should significantly enhance our current knowledge on the role of NADPH in the ER. The expected findings are relevant to understand the coupling between cellular energy state, hormonal regulation, ER redox regulation, and oxidative stress-induced damage.

The surgical standard uses vascularized, autologous bone grafts but is highly limited by donor site morbidity and availability. Alternative approaches are thus highly required to meet this strong clinical need. Regenerative approaches based on cell therapy with bone marrow-derived cells are not easily standardized and have so far shown variable clinical outcome. We have recently described the generation of an axially-vascularized bone graft substitute, based on freshly isolated, human adipose-derived cells, compatible with an intraoperative approach for bone repair, and demonstrated its potential to revitalize dead bone in a rat model of AVN. Beyond the proof-of-concept, the current limitation of this approach is the yet too limited amount of bone formation inside the axially-vascularized grafts. Working hypothesisThe development and use of osteo-inductive, engineered biomaterials, based on an endochondral ossification (ECO) paradigm, combined to an axially-vascularized graft, can generate strong and reproducible bone formation in preclinical animal models of AVN. Specific aimsIn this project, 3 aims are defined: 1) Aim 1 will compare different approaches to engineer hypertrophic cartilage tissues (HCT) and evaluate their respective ectopic bone formation capacity through an ECO process. The role of integrin receptors and extracellular matrix proteins in this process will be elucidated. 2) Aim 2 will investigate how these HCT could be devitalized while maintaining their matrix properties, in order to generate devitalized osteo-inductive matrices. The performance of such matrices in bone formation and in bone repair will be assessed. 3) Finally, aim 3 will investigate the implementation of such devitalized HCT inside the axiallyvascularized grafts we recently developed and will assess if HCT can induce a more massive, reproducible and homogenous bone formation inside the grafts and in the necrotic bone around it. Experimental designHCT will be generated either by seeding human bone marrow- and adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) onto collagen sponges, or by fractionating native, human adipose tissue followed by 3 weeks of culture on agarose-plated petri dishes. All constructs types will then be differentiated into HCT, analyzed or implanted ectopically to assess osteogenicity. The role of integrins will be studied by overexpression/silencing with lentiviral transduction/CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout. The performance of HCT, devitalized by various techniques (e.g. freeze drying or hydrostatic pressure) will be analyzed in ectopic and orthotopic (calvaria) invivo models in rodents. Axially-vascularized grafts will be generated as previously described, containing either ceramic granules (current composition) or devitalized, osteo-inductive HCT, and will be tested in the rat model of AVN for revitalization, vascularization and bone formation potential. Expected value of the proposed projectThe present project is essential to introduce a routine clinical use of axially vascularized osteogenic grafts as prefabricated bone. The knowledge gained in this study will be useful not only to define formulations for AVN applications but also for other surgical bone regeneration strategies.

The combination of core symptoms (deficits in social-communication and repetitive and restricted behaviours and interests) and common comorbidities (e.g. epilepsy and depression) significantly reduces the quality of life and life-span of affected individuals. Currently there are no effective drug treatments for the core symptoms. Key factors that have hampered progress include; 1) limited understanding of the underlying pathophysiolog(ies); 2) lack of successful translation from animal models to humans; 3) testing of drugs with specific actions in biologically heterogeneous populations; 4) limited expertise of many European ASD centres in running large-scale clinical trials; and 5) trial designs (e.g. placebo effects).  Our vision, therefore, is to apply a precision medicine approach to ASD and improve patient outcomes by tailoring treatments to a patient's biological profile. Our efforts will build on the achievements of 5 other IMI initiatives, 4 Horizon 2020 networks, and 6 SMEs for the first time to; 1) align global resources to validate and qualify stratification biomarkers from infancy to adulthood; 2) develop objective outcome measures that can be used in trials; 3) create a European-wide clinical trials network that reliably carries out studies able to support filings to the EMA/FDA; 4) carry out better targeted clinical trials linked to other international efforts - including quick wins or ""fast fails"" of ineffective agents; 5) translate molecular mechanisms and drug effects between preclinical models and particular subtypes of ASD.

MDD is associated with the second greatest number of life years lost due to premature death or disability (DALY) and will most likely be the leading cause in 2030. Physical activity counselling may increase lifestyle physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness in a particularly vulnerable population which often suffers from a mix of mental and physical health problems.Goal and specific objectives: This study will examine the effectiveness of lifestyle physical activity counselling intervention among in-patients diagnosed with MDD compared to (placebo) controls. Secondary purposes are to examine the acceptability and perceived usefulness of the intervention among the patients, to compare baseline values with an age- and gender-matched group of healthy controls, and to find out whether the effectiveness of the intervention is moderated by genetic factors.Methods: The study is designed as a multi-centric two-arm randomized clinical trial including an intervention and placebo control group, allocation concealment, double-blinding, and intention-to-treat analysis. Participants (N=334) will be continuously recruited from four clinics specialized in the treatment of MDD. The intervention builds on a standardized, theory-based, low cost lifestyle physical activity counselling program, which was specifically designed for an in-patient rehabilitation setting. The placebo control condition consists of general instructions about health-enhancing physical activity. Data assessment will take place 2-3 weeks after admission to in-patient treatment (baseline), six weeks (post) and 12 months (follow-up) after discharge from in-patient treatment. Primary outcome is objectively assessed physical activity at follow-up. Secondary outcomes are self-reported physical activity, cardiorespireatory fitness, autonomic function, cognitive and social determinants of exercise, depression severity, self-perceived physical and psychological health, insomnia symtpoms, cognitive function, cardiovascular health risk markers (blood pressure, heart rate variability, BMI, percentage body fat, total/LDL/HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, HbA1c), and biomarkers of MDD (cortisol awakening response, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and insulin-like growth factor). Moreover, the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) polymorphic promoter region (5-HTTLPR) will be assessed as a potential moderator of intervention effects.Expected results: Because regular physical activity has proved to be an important predictor of long-term response and remission in patients with major depression, we believe that our planned study may lay important groundwork by showing how individually-tailored lifestyle physical activity counselling can be integrated into given clinical structures. Our primary hypothesis is that compared to treatment as usual, individually-tailored physical activity counselling in patients with MDD will lead to clinically relevant increases in physical activity and CRF, and that these outcomes will persist beyond clinical discharge. The planned study is innovative for several reasons. For instance, we will test for the first time the potential of individually-tailored physical activity counselling in psychiatric in-patients, (b) focus on patients with low physical activity levels, and (c) assess physical activity objectively via accelerometry. Significance and feasibility: Improving physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness may have important implications for tackling metabolic and cardiovascular disease and increasing cognitive functioning in this at-risk population, hence, reducing the future burden of multiple chronic conditions. Increased physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness may also reduce the likelihood of future depressive episodes. By moving toward the primary prevention of chronic physical conditions, much can be done to enhance the quality and quantity of life of people with MDD. These findings will strengthen the evidence for ""exercise as medicine"" as a holistic care option in routine clinical practice for people with MDD, by helping patients to adopt and maintain physically active lifestyles after the end of their hospital stay. The study can show feasible ways to achieve long-term behaviour change by integrating lifestyle physical activity counselling into given clinical structures. Moreover, the study will show whether such an approach is acceptable for in-patients treated for MDD, and how much financial resources are needed to implement lifestyle physical activity counselling.",NA,external_funding,Active,4443982,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,305,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Among these the ""great Greek colonisation"" of the early 1st millenium BC is of particular relevance as it resulted in the expansion of Greek civilisation into the Western part of the Mediterranean and onto the Italian peninsula in particular. While this process of cultural interaction has hitherto been regarded primarily from a Graeco-centric point of view, it is currently being studied more intensively with regard to the effects it had on the native inhabitants of South Italy and on the emergence of new forms of cultural identity, both for the immigrants and for the local population. Until recently this encounter was first and foremost discussed on the basis of the material evidence from archaeological contexts. It has meanwhile become evident, however, that the cultural interactions initiated in the ""Greek colonization"" constitute complex processes that cannot be understood by a simple binary opposition between Greeks and Non-Greeks as reflected in culturally connoted artefacts. In order to overcome this aporia the present project proposes a new methodological approach to the question of ""identity"" in the colonial world by combining archaeological with scientific analysis and by studying both the material evidence as well as the physical remains of the human actors.By testing the feasibility of ancient DNA studies and conducting stable isotope analyses on the skeletal remains from various cemeteries in Northern Calabria we want to develop a broad interdisciplinary basis for the discussions of the social, cultural and economic transformations taking place in South Italy during and in the aftermath of the ""Greek colonisation"". At the same time it is planned to continue archaeological investigations in the Macchiabate necropolis of Francavilla Marittima, which is a key site in assessing the diverse effects of the ""Greek colonisation"" in South Italy. Our aims are twofold: on the one hand, the excavations serve to improve our understanding of the cultural identity of the people buried in the native necropolis at the time of the flouruit of the nearby colony of Sybaris (7th/6th century BC), a period largely neglected by scholarly research in favor of the earlier, pre-colonial phases of the cemetery; on the other hand the investigations will provide new and well documented osteologic and archaeobiometric data for the assessment of the biological and social identity discourse mentioned above.With its rich material heritage Francavilla Marittima is the ideal place to conduct our research. There we will be able to profit from our longstanding experience with the site and exploit both the material culture and human skeletal remains to achieve the best possible results.In order to understand the phenomenon of cultural interaction in its broader terms it is important to extend the horizon of the investigation to the whole of Northern Calabria and even beyond. A PhD-thesis will therefore be devoted to the archaic burial practices in the Sibaritide in general; a postdoc project will investigate similar processes of interaction in the neighbouring Locride. By its integrative approach comprising archaeological and scientific methods as well as theoretical models the present project introduces a trend-setting methodological dimension into the current archaeological debate, shedding new light on the cultural as well as on the physical identity of the people living in the colonial world, both before and after the foundation of the Greek colonies.

Understanding the general principles underlying the evolution of pathogens will be essential to design strategies shifting away from classical approaches that rely entirely on antimicrobial chemotherapy. I propose to study both the molecular mechanisms supporting virulence in entero-pathogens and to assess their evolutionary dynamics in response to factors limiting the infection (i.e., the colonization resistance, mediated by the intestinal microbiota, and the adaptive immunity in vaccinated hosts, which dampen the fitness of targeted pathogens). This will lay the foundation for preventive treatments based on rational control of pathogens in populations of hosts. My group will focus on the model organism Salmonella enterica Typhimurium, in which the expression of virulence is metabolically costly. This favors the emergence of attenuated mutants (defectors) during infections. Moreover, the expression of virulence is bimodal in S. Typhimurium, i.e., the bacteria switch phenotypically back and forth from virulent to avirulent. Bimodality in virulence expression is a feature of general relevance observed in many pathogens. However, its selective value remains poorly understood. In S. Typhimurium, bimodality seems to offset the cost of virulence and to slowdown the rise of defectors. This suggests that tightly regulated bimodal expression of virulence could represent an unexploited ""Achilles' heel"". This will be addressed by further developing theoretical and experimental frameworks to quantify the within-host and between-host evolutionary dynamics of S. Typhimurium. This should reveal both the conditions required to drive loss of virulence and pathogen fitness in a population of hosts, and potential drug-able molecular targets that could generate these conditions.",Phenotypic variability; Transmission; Evolution; Vaccination; Intestinal microbiota; Salmonella spp; Biocontrol; Virulence; Gene regulation,external_funding,Active,4348716,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,307,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

We will investigate these processes longitudinally with three- to six-year-old children in Switzerland and Germany. We are a team of interdisciplinary collaborators working in linguistics, education, and developmental and cognitive psychological science based in two countries with three societal languages. Each local research group contributes state-of-the art paradigms, diagnostic procedures, and methods from their field to establish a common general model of single and dual language learning in the social context. The results are intended to be generalizable across countries, languages, and contexts.             The collaborative research design focuses on four samples at each site of the participants (Basel, Bern, Neuchâtel, Würzburg), each with n = 188 three- and four-year old single and dual language learners (Ntotal= 750).

Levodopa is a promising candidate for pharmacological enhancement of stroke recovery. Dopamine is a key player in processes of motor learning, reward, and brain plasticity. Preclinical research and studies with healthy individuals suggest, that there is scope for benefit from applying levodopa in addition to standardized rehabilitation. Indeed, there are some, however limited and inconsistent data from small randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing levodopa in stroke patients. The largest, recently completed but not yet published ""Dopamine in Rehabilitation of Stroke"" (DARS)-trial did not indicate a benefit of levodopa. A preliminary meta-analysis across 6 RCTs (including DARS) indicated the possibility of a more favorable outcome in levodopa-treated stroke patients than in control patients. Heterogeneity between trials was considerable. The RCTs differed with regard to patient populations (chronic/acute stroke), types of stroke (ischemic/hemorrhagic), dosage and duration of the study treatment, length of follow-up, and outcome measures. None mentioned adaptation of concomitant rehabilitative therapies to the principles of motor learning. Of note, safety concerns were absent. Motor deficits are common and affect quality of life in stroke patients prompting for motor improvement as a top priority. Given the high prevalence and tremendous burden of stroke, a straightforward applicable measure to improve motor outcome is highly relevant. Given the promising but inconclusive clinical trial evidence on benefits, a well-designed, randomized controlled trial studying the usefulness of levodopa in enhancing motor recovery after stroke is warranted.Aim: to study whether levodopa compared to placebo given in addition to standardized rehabilitation based on the principles of motor learning is associated with a patient-relevant enhancement of functional recovery in acute ischemic stroke patients.Design: Multicenter, randomized (ratio 1:1), parallel-group, placebo-controlled superiority trial with blinded patients, care-providers, investigators, and outcome assessors.Patients: Patients with acute ischemic stroke (= 7days) causing clinically meaningful hemiparesis. Eligibility criteria: (i)in-hospital-rehabilitation required and patient capable to participate in standardized rehabilitation therapy; (ii)previous independence in daily living; (iii)absence of indications for dopaminergic agents; (iv)absence of contraindications for levodopa; (v)informed consent.Intervention: Levodopa 100mg/Carbidopa 25mg three times daily, administered for 5 weeks in addition to standardized rehabilitative therapy.Comparison: Matching placebo.Outcome Measures: The primary outcome is the between-group difference of final scores in the Fugl-Meyer-Motor Assessment-(FMA) measured 3 months after randomization. The FMA will also be assessed at the end of study treatment, at 6 and 12 months. Secondary outcomes include patient-reported outcomes, Rivermead Mobility Index, NIH-Stroke Scale score, modified Rankin Scale, Box-and-Block-Test, Jamar dynamometer test, and as measures of harm: mortality, recurrent stroke, and serious adverse events.Main statistical hypothesis: Levodopa administered in addition to standardized rehabilitative therapy is superior to placebo and standardized rehabilitative therapy, resulting in an at least 6 points higher FMA score at 3 months.Sample Size: 610 patients will be recruited. The sample size is estimated to detect a statistically significant and clinically meaningful difference between treatment groups of =6 points in the FMA at 3 months (primary outcome) assuming it is normally distributed with a standard deviation of 25 points (power 80%, two-sided significance level 5%, drop-out-rate 10%).",NA,external_funding,Active,4480020,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,310,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Using (mobile) eye-tracking to study attention biases towards threat-related stimuli,2018,"Theoretical background. The attention bias towards threat is defined by anxious individuals' tendency to overly attend threat-related information compared to neutral material. However, an exploration of this bias in a naturalistic setting is missing. Furthermore, albeit being observed that anxiety impairs intuition, the relationship between the bias and intuitive information processing has been neglected so far. Therefore, the project addresses the following research question: 1) Is the attention bias replicable in a naturalistic setting? 2) Do bias-related eye movement patterns differ with respect to exogenous and endogenous attention? 3) Does the intuition hindering effect of anxiety apply to threat-related material? 4) Does intuition influence the attention bias in high trait anxious? Design and methodology of the proposed study. The project has two parts: In the naturalistic part, after a mood induction, participants will explore a museum-like room (naturalistic setting) and perform a choice task regarding posters of paintings with different valences while wearing glasses for obtaining eye movements. In the first experiment of the experimental part, after a mood manipulation, participants will perform an intuition task consisting of threat-stimuli. In the second experiment, after the induction of an intuitive vs. reflective information processing mode, participants will perform an emotional stroop task to assess the attention bias towards threat.

While the surface state in a topological insulator (TI) is composed of chiral fermions carrying charge and spin, in topological superconductors it is pinned to zero energy due to particle-hole symmetry and composed of fermions that carry neither charge nor spin. Instead, they are non-abelian fermions, Majorana and parafermions (MF/PF), that have been proposed for topological quantum computing. Evidence for MFs have been found in nanowires. However, the scaling-up challenge requires a platform in which networks of MFs can be realized. Here, we propose to use graphene-based van der Waals heterostructure for this purpose. The unprecedented versatility is enabled by combining high-mobility graphene with other layered materials, such as transition-metal dichalcogenide, few-layer ferromagnets and superconductors (SCs). This allows to design topological systems, e.g. the quantum spin, anomalous and valley Hall effect, by combining Zeeman energy, spin-orbit and pairing interaction. We will design 2D quantum matter using different approaches, including strain tuning and the dressing of the bandstructure by photon-fields (Floquet TI), and couple it to SCs to induce topological superconductivity. We will use our expertise from studies of Cooper-pair splitters to not only add pairing in a single edge-state, but also between different edge-states, beneficial for obtaining MFs and more exotic quasiparticles. We will apply advanced high-frequency techniques, e.g. emission and noise - in addition to local tunneling spectroscopy - to characterize the in-gap states and to prove their topological nature. We will deliver a versatile technology with which new states of matter can be obtained in a platform which can be engineered in a top-down manner into networks allowing for quantum-state manipulation of MFs and PFs.","topological insulator, van der Waals material, two-dimensional materials, quantum transport, topological superconductivity, Majorana physics",external_funding,Active,4478779,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,315,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

"Schulzke, Sven","Delgado-Eckert, Edgar",Bereich Kinder- und Jugendheilkunde (Klinik) / Neonatologie (Schulzke),Predictive value of heart rate variability on cardiorespiratory events of preterm infants routinely immunised in the hospital,2018,"Preterm birth is a major challenge of health care systems across the globe, affecting about 10% of all infants born worldwide, resulting in almost 13 million preterm births per year. The autonomic nervous system of preterm infants is characterized by instability of heart rate and breathing, requiring continuous monitoring of vital signs over several months and long-term respiratory support. Cardiorespiratory events due to this instability, summarised under the term 'apnoea of prematurity' (AOP), affect at least 80% of very preterm infants born before 32 weeks of gestation. AOP may lead to severe hypoxaemia requiring immediate resuscitation and recent data show that repetitive episodes of AOP increase the risk of post-discharge death and long-term neurodevelopmental impairment. Most importantly, severity and frequency of AOP may drastically increase upon challenging the autonomic system by routine immunisation. It is, however, very important to provide timely immunisation and establish early immunity against typical vaccine-preventable diseases in preterm infants as they are particularly vulnerable to complications arising from those diseases. Current recommendations are to initially immunise preterm infants in the hospital under continuous monitoring of vital signs if the treating physician considers an infant to be at risk of post-immunisation AOP. However, there are no objective criteria to predict post-immunisation AOP. Although the first immunisation of very preterm infants typically takes place in the hospital under continuous monitoring of vital signs, immunisations of infants at risk of AOP are often delayed due to fear of AOP or may be initiated in non-intensive care settings (normal wards) where adequate respiratory support cannot be provided but may be needed due to post-immunisation AOP. Also, due to an international trend of early discharge home of preterm infants, immunisations may be arranged in the rooms of the family paediatrician without further monitoring of vital signs and no specific knowledge of the individual risk of post-immunisation AOP. Thus, developing of new biomarkers and objective criteria to better understand and assess the risk of post-immunisation AOP is urgently needed. We recently developed a systematic quality control algorithm for assessing heart rate variability data in a standardised manner and demonstrated that the sample entropy (SampEn) of interbeat intervals, a parameter of heart rate variability derived from nonlinear time series analysis, predicts cardiorespiratory stability in preterm infants. SampEn reflects the regularity of heart rate and the presence of spikes in a given time series of heart beats and has been validated to be a reliable predictor of incipient events such as sepsis. SampEn of heart rate can be obtained non-invasively from electrocardiogram monitors, which are routinely used to monitor preterm infants immunised in the hospital. We aim to evaluate whether real-time calculation of SampEn at a) 32 and 36 weeks corrected age, b) upon primary routine immunisation in the hospital, c) at discharge from the hospital after initial prematurity-related hospital stay, and d) on readmission for immunisation in the hospital based on previous post-immunisation AOP or referral of the family paediatrician has prognostic utility for the risk of post-immunisation AOP in very preterm infants. We will further assess whether immunisation itself initiates a step response in SampEn and compare SampEn values from preterm infants to those of term healthy infants to study maturational effects. The biomarker SampEn provides a unique opportunity to objectively prognosticate autonomic stability with the goal of optimising risk stratification and establishing timely immunisation in preterm infants. Such real-time display of SampEn thus could become a valuable tool to better understand autonomic regulation in preterm infants and guide physicians in providing an optimal level of care for immunisation based on personalised risk assessment in order to provide an adequate setting and staffing. This approach combines both novel scientific aspects on prognostic value of nonlinear time series analysis and pragmatic utility of SampEn for decision-making on within hospital risk-stratification and necessity of readmission for immunisation.",NA,external_funding,Active,4439834,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,317,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"Huwyler, Jörg",NA,Departement Pharmazeutische Wissenschaften / Pharmazeutische Technologie (Huwyler),Development of novel synthetic gene transfer vectors for metabolic liver therapy,2018,"Therapeutic vectors for gene delivery remain the currently most challenging factor for human gene therapy. The translation from in vitro to in vivo applications remains a major hurdle for most nucleic acid delivery systems since there is an inherent lack of both efficient and safe carrier systems. For liver targeting of postmitotic hepatocytes, adeno-associated virus (AAV) derived vectors are thought to have the greatest potential despite concerns about a future routine clinical use. The major hurdles of AAV vectors for long-term treatment of pediatric patients are the risk of chromosomal integration and development of hepatocellular carcinoma, immune responses to viral vectors, limited loading capacity, and the difficulty to treat neonates which likely would require subsequent further injections. Consequently, the development of non-viral gene delivery systems has gained much attention due to their versatility, safety, and ease of manufacturing. During the last decades, a wide range of nanoparticle based gene delivery systems were developed and remarkable results in the field of RNA therapeutics were achieved. However, the induced pharmacological effects obtained by these siRNA or mRNA delivery strategies are short-lived and thus weekly administrations of therapeutic formulations are necessary. The use of DNA-based therapeutics would offer a favorable option for the induction of long-term therapeutic effects without need for insertion into the genome. Here, we propose an alternative approach to overcome the challenges of viral vectors or RNA-based therapeutics by developing novel nanoparticles for delivery of non-integrating, so-called minicircle (MC) vectors lacking any viral or bacterial components for liver-directed gene therapy. The successful use of MC vectors to treat genetic (metabolic) liver defects is based on the experience of one application partner with naked DNA-vectors delivered in an experimental setting by hydrodynamic pressure to either target pericentral or periportal hepatocytes to treat two classical defects in mouse models for human diseases, phenylketonuria (PKU) and ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, respectively. Such MC vectors exhibited persistent expression combined with basically no DNA size limitation, which made it possible to use natural promoters/enhancers in combination with introns to mimic ""physiological"" expression. While MC vectors bear almost ideal properties with great potential for liver gene therapy, delivery of naked DNA solely by hydrodynamic pressure is not applicable in a clinical setting. In an interdisciplinary approach, we want to develop multifunctional polymeric nanoparticles encapsulating MC vectors for non-viral gene delivery specifically to the key pathogenic cell type, i.e. hepatocytes. In order to optimize gene delivery efficiency, a novel library of polymer-peptide hybrids will be created, formulations strategies will be optimized and resulting nanoparticles will be validated in vivo using various animal models, i.e. transgenic mice, xenotransplanted mice with human liver or pig models. The combination of this novel class of polymer-peptide hybrids with a reproducible and scalable nanoparticle formulation technique (i.e. microfluidics) is expected to greatly impact further optimization of the synthetic gene delivery system for clinical applications. The overall aim of this translational project is the development of an alternative approach to AAV vectors with the potential of a breakthrough for liver gene therapy and thus a paradigm shift from potentially harmful viral vectors to safe, efficient and completely synthetic non-viral vectors.",metabolic liver disesase; ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency; phenylketonuria (PKU); DNA based therapeutics; non-viral gene delivery; polymer based nanoparticles; liver gene therapy,external_funding,Active,4479985,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,318,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

The considered linear systems are present in high-dimensional kernel-based approximation and in training of ML models (kernel ridge regression, support vector machines, Gaussian process regression). Clusters of GPUs are well-known to be extremely efficient for the direct solution of dense linear systems by factorization. However, this high pre-asymptotic performance is not sufficient to tackle very large problem sizes in the range of millions to billions of unknowns due to cubic complexity. Therefore, optimal (non-cubic) complexity solvers are necessary: ""Hierarchical matrices"" provide a means to approximate the dense system matrices of interest leading to a complexity reduction of matrix-vector products from quadratic to log-linear complexity. They are therefore the key core component for large scale solvers, which will be brought forward by this project. While the first allocation by the applicant (PHY109) considered multi-GPU dense iterative solvers without approximation (-&gt; new software library ""MPLA"" (Open Source, Github)) and an initial development phase of a single-GPU hierarchical matrix approach, the second allocation (CSC238) considered the main development of a single-GPU hierarchical matrix library (-&gt; new software library ""hmglib"" (Open Source, Github)) and an initial development of a multi-GPU version of the library (with two resulting preprints and two further preprints being based on calculations done in the DD).

Second, the technology of hierarchical matrices shall be further developed such that it supports the very high-dimensional training space required for the QML application. These high-dimensional techniques will not be limited to this application, however, they will be rather general for many machine learning applications.

Extracellular matrices (ECMs) have been proposed for the physiological presentation of various cytokines at sites of tissue repair to activate and regulate endogenous cells. ECMs do not need to be derived from native tissues, but can be tissue-engineered and then devitalized. This provides the potential advantages of standardization (e.g., thanks to the use of cell lines) and of customization (e.g., by transducing cells to overexpress defined factors). ECMs could be engineered to deliver not only osteoinductive factors, but also immunomodulatory signals, which are increasingly being recognized as strong regulators in bone regeneration. Working hypothesis. We hypothesize that engineered and devitalized ECMs, specifically enriched in osteoinductive factors (BMP-2), as well as in cytokines polarizing immune response towards a pro-regenerative phenotype (IL4) and resolving acute inflammation (IL1Ra), can enhance bone regeneration. Specific aims. In order to generate the modular bricks for the engineering of ECMs, cell lines expressing different instructive cues (BMP-2, IL4 and IL1Ra) will be derived from an existing death-inducible human mesenchymal cell line (MSOD) (Aim1). ECMs enriched with different combinations and doses of such cues will be engineered, characterized and tested in a standard ectopic implantation model (Aim2). The capacity of these ECMs in modulating human immune cell recruitment and polarization will be investigated in vitro (Aim3). The effect of signals presented by ECMs on bone repair and the possible role of macrophages and T cells will be investigated in a rat critical sized calvarial defect (Aim4).Experimental design. Three cell lines will be generated by lentivirally transducing the MSOD line to express BMP2, IL4 and IL1Ra under the control of inducible promoters, and characterized in vitro for secretion of factors, proliferation, differentiation capacity and death-induction responsiveness (Aim1). Generated cell lines will be cultured on collagen scaffolds within a perfusion bioreactor to engineer ECMs, enriched in the different instructive signals. Obtained ECMs will be assessed for protein content and release, compatibility with inducible apoptosis and osteoinductive potential (Aim2). The immunomodulatory effect of engineered ECMs will be evaluated in an in vitro human setup based on i) chemokine release profiles, ii) recruitment and polarization of macrophages and iii) macrophage-mediated polarization of T cells (Aim3).

Recent developments on the instrumentation side have made possible the collection of large amounts of high quality data, bringing up the necessity of establishing efficient frameworks for data analysis that can operate with none to minimal human supervision. Ideal efficiency would be marked by the ability to perform an online analysis of the raw data produced by the microscope.This proposal devises the development and posterior integration of distinct numerical tasks that jointly cover the full computational pipeline that links the raw data gained in a session of tomographic data collection (i.e., a tilt series of micrographs of the sample imaged at different orientations at the electron microscope) to the final results in the form of averaged models of the macromolecules of interest, possibly classified in different functional states, or as automated annotations of the tomogram contents. The final aim of establishing a high-throughput analysis sets the goal of achieving a full and unsupervised completion of this workflow in the order of magnitude of the minutes, matching the time needed by current instrumentation to collect a full tilt series.Already at the level of selection of recording sites on the carbon grid that supports the sample during the imaging session, we intend to refine the current, in-house developed image processing system for computerized selection of viable holes (recording sites) through a deep learning system that learns and automatically applies the selection patterns preferred by experienced human users. After selection of the holes, the next automation requirement is the mutual alignment of the micrographs representing different views. The approach suggested in this approach combines the two main procedural families (location of gold bead fiducials and alignment of micrographs to global tomogram reprojections), joining them through the introduction of an initial model computed by a genetic algorithm type on the central tilts, typically the ones with the highest signal content. This initial model allows for a gradual integration of micrographs of higher tilts through a mutual validation of global reprojection and individual gold bead identifications.The final automation stage concerns the interpretation of the tomogram content, both regarding the off-line discovery of hidden structures, and the on-line identification of copies of compounds of interest, which might appear -depending of the case- in a wide range of supporting geometries defined by the general architecture of the tomogram contents.Algorithmic development will be closely followed by integration in our well established, in-house package Dynamo, ensuring both the availability of an extensive codebase for efficient development of scientific software, and an enormous visibility of the output of this project, due to the widespread used of our software suite.",NA,external_funding,Active,4444149,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,327,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

"Maier, Timm","Hall, Michael N.",Departement Biozentrum / Structural Biology (Maier),Feasibility study: Development of a lead compound for specific mTORC1 inhibition,2018,"mTORC1 is a master regulator of cell growth and metabolism. mTORC1 is an important pharmacological target as its deregulation is implicated in multiple diseases. However, the clinical applicability of the currently available mTORC1 inhibitors (rapamycin and its derivatives) is limited by their specificity, effectiveness, and safety. Chronic and systemic administration of current mTORC1 inhibitors is often associated with undesirable side effects on metabolism, including hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance. This hinders the use of mTORC1 inhibition as a pharmacologic strategy to treat multiple conditions with unmet therapeutic needs. They include cancer, epilepsy, depression, autism and stroke, obesity and diabetes, autoimmunity, age-related pathologies. We aim to generate a lead compound that justifies its further development into a drug to treat diseases arising from unbridled mTORC1 activity. Initially, we intend to focus on the lifelong tumor syndrome TSC (tuberous sclerosis complex) and, in the long term, to other conditions mentioned above. mTORC1 substrate recruitment is an unexplored pharmacological target. We provided a structural basis for analyzing this process. Based on this study, we established a biophysical assay to identify novel compounds that block mTORC1 substrate recruitment. We expect such compounds to be more specific, effective and safer than the currently available mTORC1 inhibitors, possibly allowing for higher dose or prolonged treatment. The clinical potential of these novel compounds would be immense and readily testable. This project displays a considerable innovation potential.

"Bailer, Stefanie","Giger, Nathalie",Departement Gesellschaftswissenschaften / Politikwissenschaften (Bailer),New Relations Between Voters and Representatives in the Age of Social Media,2018,"This project aims to lay the groundwork for a deeper understanding of the relation between voters and elected representatives in the age of social media. Social media platforms like Twitter carry the potential to transform democracies as they allow for direct contact between politicians and voters and thus for more personalized contact between representatives and represented. Academic work on this topic, however, has so far remained highly descriptive and has focussed on the frequency or volume of social media usage by politicians and not so much on the content of their messages. As a result, we lack knowledge about the information politicians portray in social media activity, as well as what the effect of this communication is, e.g. how voters perceive it. The two studies presented in this proposal intend to target this important research gap and to analyse the micro-processes of the content of online communication and how voters perceive it. Study 1 ('What Do Politicians Tweet When? New Quantitative Insight Into the Strategic Use of Personality Traits and Policy Positions') is an observational study that investigates the tweets of a sample of Swiss and German politicians with the help of machine-learning to find out more about the motivations of politicians to tweet. We focus on Twitter as direct and individualized behaviour is best captured with this platform. Following key ideas in the representation and personalisation literature, we focus specifically on the distinction between personal or policy focussed content and investigate whether the content of the tweets depends on variables such as the incentive to cultivate a personal vote, professionalization of parties and parliament, or career stage in comparative perspective - information that is already available from the SNF project on ""Parliamentary careers in comparison"" . Study 2 ('What do voters want: Policy or Person') is a two country survey including an experiment that investigates how voters use social media for political purposes and which information they seek in these platforms. A short survey experiment focuses on how feelings of representation and voting intentions of voters are affected by the content of the twitter message that politicians share via social media and whether voters rather appreciate personal appeals about the politicians or information about policy positions and activities communicated via Twitter. Using an innovative survey design, we first extract the demographic personal profile and policy preferences of the participants. We then use this information to present subjects with candidate profiles and Tweets from politicians that are (dis)similar to them on these key dimensions. As such we contribute to the question whether voters appreciate politicians similar or dissimilar to their own personal profile (desire for descriptive representation) and feel better represented by politicians who are like them or who act on their behalf (desire for substantive representation). The conduct of these studies in Switzerland and Germany allows for a first insight on variation on relevant influencing variables such as the election system, the importance of parties and the professionalization of the parliamentary system. Importantly, this project forms the base for a larger research agenda that we aim to develop in the next years and where we want to further explore the potential of social media in fostering closer linkages between voters and politicians.","social media, representation, politicians, voters, gender",external_funding,Completed,4484481,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,333,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"Sangouard, Nicolas",NA,Departement Physik / Quantum Physics (Sangouard),Certifying the quantum nature of complex systems from Bell's theorem,2018,"In 1964, John Bell studied a simple game in which two black-boxes receive classical inputs and produce classical outputs only. He devised a test to certify that the correlations between the outputs cannot be explained by classical means from the sole knowledge of the input/output statistics. While this test - now known as a Bell test - is appealing to highlight limits of classical physics, it has been realized in 1992 that it can be used to certify that the state on which the black boxes operate is a well identified entangled state. As entanglement is at the core of secure communication, the Bell test is nowadays seen as a trustworthy technique to certify the security of communication tools, independently of the details and imperfections of the actual implementations. Although the Bell test occupies a privileged position in physics at the interface between funda- mental and applied physics, it has been implemented in small systems only, involving at most 14 particles. We took the next step during my SNSF professorship by showing how it can be applied to large systems. In collaboration with the Treutlein group in Basel, we succeeded in witnessing Bell-correlations between hundreds of spins, that is, we have shown that the correlations between hundreds of atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate can be strong enough to violate a Bell inequality. The first aim of the extension of my professorship is to build upon these initial results and create a complete mathematical framework for the characterization of quantum multi-partite and many-body systems from Bell tests. We will clarify the relation between key forms of quantum correlations like entanglement and Bell correlations. We will develop practical tools to quantify these quantum correlations in multi-partite systems. We will also work on statistical issues to understand how quantum many-body systems compare with their classical counterparts when working with finite statistics. Upon success, we will lay the theoretical groundwork that is needed to report on the first Bell test with a many-body system, hence demonstrating its quantum nature in a fully black-box scenario. The second objective of my project is to highlight the potential of Bell tests to certify the proper functioning of complex quantum technologies that are not necessarily trusted and are anyway too complicated to be modelled accurately. In particular, we will lay the basis for a completely new class of certification methods for arbitrary channels. We will show how they can be used to certify quantum memories and following a recent proposal that has been granted by the SNSF in September 2017, we will also apply them to quantum computing. We will work in close collaboration with leading experimental groups and upon success, we will participate to the first-proof-of-principle experiments certifying complex quantum technologies by demonstrating that they behave as instructed even when using imperfectly described systems. The one billion euro flagship initiative for quantum technologies that will be launch in 2018 makes this research line very timely.

They affect older persons living both in the community and nursing homes. Available evidence suggests that up to 10% of community living older adults are at risk of experiencing abuse within a period of one year. In the nursing homes, 10% - 80% of the nurses report having committed or witnessing an act of abuse towards older patients. Although people may believe that such poor actions does not occur ""in my backyard"", elder abuse and ageism affects economically rich nations such as Switzerland as well. To date there is lack of both research and socially oriented projects to address this societal and ethical problem. The World Health Organization, the European Union, and national organizations working for older adults highlight the importance of addressing elder abuse and ageism since older person like everyone else have the right to live a life of dignity, free from abuse, and discrimination. Finally, in light of the demographic change with the greying of the population addressing this concern is of utmost importance. Thus, the goal of this community oriented project in Switzerland is to raise awareness on elder abuse and ageism in the country by inviting participants to take a critical look at stereotypes and age discriminations. We aim to achieve our goal through the following objectives:  Allow exchange between different populations on intergenerational relationships, age, and the ageing process. Seek to positively impact participants' perspectives and attitudes towards age, ageing, and ills of elder abuse Provide knowledge on the mechanisms to address elder abuse and ageism  The project consists of short films screenings followed by a discussion with the audience on ageing, ageism, and elder abuse. Three different types of events will be carried out 18 times in total, both in the German and French speaking parts of Switzerland. Participation will be free of costs for all audience. The procedure will be the same for the three types of events, but the target population will differ. Event A (Special screenings and debate) will bring together nursing homes residents (n=90), occupational therapists (n=18), and high school students (n=300) and their teachers (n=12). Event A will reach 438 persons. Event B (Festival screenings and debate) will target the general population, festival public, and film professionals (Total reach n=450). Event C (Public screenings and debate) will focus on the general population, among others older people in the community, family caregivers, health and social professionals, etc. (Total reach n=1250). Overall, the project will directly have an impact on 2138 persons in Switzerland. A well-structured communication and public relations concept will increase the impact of the project. It includes communication in digital and traditional medias (national, local, and specialized), as well as publications in professional and scientific newsletters. Eight short movies on ageing, intergenerational relationships, ageism and elder abuse have been produced during Spring 2017 by ECAL students (Ecole cantonale d'art de Lausanne, University of Applied Sciences and Arts Western Switzerland, Bachelor in cinema) in collaboration with two professional film directors and the applicant's team. They will be used as a medium for discussions and debate with participants. Media is a creative way to send a strong message in neutral ways. As these movies are artistic works, they offer to think in another way, they invite to take a new look at stereotypes and discrimination. A quiz on ageism will also be completed by the participants before the screening and discussed during the debate. A short evaluation survey will also be used to assess objectives' achievement. All participants will receive a booklet including a short presentation of each short movies, facts sheets about ageing, ageism, and elder abuse, the quiz on ageism and the evaluation survey.

The analysis of a reporter mouse line, in which the fractalkine receptor CX3CR1 can be tracked by expression of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) has led to the identification of phagocytes that extend processes between intestinal epithelial cells into the intestinal lumen (Science. 2005; 307, 254). Further characterization revealed that CX3CR1+ phagocytes express CD68 and are likely macrophages, from which DCs can be discriminated by the expression of the integrin alpaE (CD103) (J Immunol. 2010; 15, 2026). Intestinal macrophages capture and process antigens and microbial compounds in the intestine and deliver these antigens to DCs, which migrate to the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) to prime naïve T cells (Mucosal Immunol. 2014; 7, 533). Our preliminary work shows that macrophages and DCs express the G protein coupled receptor GPR35, that has been identified as the receptor for the chemokine CXCL17 and for which a single nucleotide polymorphism has been described to be associated with ulcerative colitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis, but whose function in the gastrointestinal tract is largely unknown. OBJETIVESIn this proposal we will investigate if intestinal DCs and macrophages express GPR35 and if GPR35 is needed for the establishment of oral tolerance and for the development of colitis. Specifically, the following aims will be addressed: 1. The cells that express GPR35 will be defined. 2. Whether GPR35 is required for the establishment of oral tolerance, and 3. whether GPR35 regulates the migration of macrophages and DCs to the inflamed colon during colitis will be examined. METHODSA GPR35-tdTomato reporter mouse line has been generated in order to identify the cells that express GPR35. After identification of the cell that expresses GPR35, the function of GPR35 for the establishment of oral tolerance. In this model, mice will be gavaged with Ovalbumin (OVA), mice will be then immunized with OVA, and splenocytes will be isolated and will be tested for their ability to produce IFN? after restimulation with OVA.

SIGNIFICANCEThis proposal aims to identify the cell that expresses GPR35 and to examine the function of GPR35, which has been identified as a chemokine receptor for the chemokine CXCL17. The migration of DCs and macrophages into the lamina propria of the small and large intestine and trafficking of DCs from the lamina propria to the mesenteric lymph nodes are of importance for the establishment of oral tolerance and the development of colitis. Whether GPR35 influences the trafficking of DCs and macrophages and contributes to the establishment of oral tolerance and the development of colitis is not known. The better understanding of the mechanism underlying the migration of macrophages and DCs to the lamina propria and trafficking of DCs to the MLN will give insights how inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) develops and may potentially uncover a novel target to treat IBD.",NA,external_funding,Active,3923155,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,337,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

This project addresses these shortcomings by focusing on large-scale infrastructure as a matter of design, with often far-reaching consequences for urban and rural territories across Africa. During both the colonial and post-independence periods, planners, engineers, architects, and government officials consciously attempted to reshape Africa through specific infrastructural projects. Such projects had various goals, from facilitating resource exploitation and strengthening colonial control to integrating the continent into a Pan-African unity after independence and facilitating economic development today. This project examines key infrastructural visions as well as their material realizations and often contradictory effects on the ground.

We want to capture this perceived and claimed ""differentness"" theoretically and by analyzing the states' concrete endeavors to sustainabilize themselves. Accordingly, the project strives for contributing to an improved understanding of the self-transformation of the political-administrative system toward sustainability.Hereby, the project builds on the results of an explorative pre-study. To substantiate this preliminary work, we will approach the overall question on three levels. First, we look at the generic aspects of ""sustainabilization"" on a conceptual level. We especially want to elaborate a framework of the sustainable state with regard to its own internal and external governance functions. Second and based on the according conceptual basis, we will empirically analyze the practical efforts of sustainabilizing Swiss cantonal administrations. An important reason for choosing the subnational level is that the pre-study revealed a diversity of already developed practices. Hence, the framework could be applied to different cases and an informative comparison can be established. Third, the project includes a practice-oriented level by collaborating with cantonal representatives in an accompanying focus group not only to disseminate research results, but also to ensure a mutual learning process between the practitioners and the research team. The latter builds on the dialogue between scholars and sustainability administrators from Swiss cantons already established in the pre-study.The scientific part is composed of a theoretical part and an empirical part. We first develop an analytical framework of the sustainable state, based on a critical discussion of concepts from transition, sustainability, and governance theory. The empirical part will be guided but what we take to be a new and innovative framework. Based on a documentary analysis to reveal existing forms of the sustainable state in all Swiss cantons, we will select distinct cases for further in-depth inquiries. We will employ a qualitative case study approach to investigate the working of sustainability governance arrangements in selected Swiss cantons and we will assess their capacities to bring forth functions of sustainable governance with reference to the analytical framework. To do so, we will conduct interviews with key actors in the public administration as well societal actors. We will analyze the data using methods of qualitative content analysis. Finally, and employing the method of process tracing, we will capture the formation of sustainability governance arrangements in the selected cases.With the project, we add innovative knowledge to the sustainability governance literature in mainly four respects. First, it establishes an informed notion of the governance functions of the sustainable state. Second, it provides empirical knowledge on sustainable transformation processes within the state along the studied Swiss cantons.

Decades of research have implicated a multitude of genetic factors in bacterial persister formation, but no comprehensive understanding or effective treatments have so far been developed. It is therefore time to employ a genuinely new approach that may help to turn the tide against bacterial persistence.The current crisis of antibacterial therapy has recently revived interest in bacterial viruses called bacteriophages for their ability to eliminate multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens (""phage therapy""). Successful application of phage therapy approaches includes chronic infections that are often linked to bacterial persister cells, indicating that bacteriophages have strategies to overcome their dormancy and kill them. In this project I therefore aim at comprehensively unraveling bacteriophage strategies to overcome the recalcitrance of bacterial persisters. I will therefore identify bacteriophages that are particularly proficient in killing persister cells, determine the genetic basis of this ability, and explore how bacteriophages manipulate the dormant physiology of persisters to their advantage. I anticipate that this research project will uncover true Achilles' heels in the physiology of persister cells that may be shared among different bacterial pathogens.

"Knopp, Stefanie",NA,Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH),The last mile: novel tools and strategies for breaking schistosomiasis transmission,2018,"Background and rationale: Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) with a considerable impact on global health. Since the mid-1980s, efforts in endemic countries mainly focussed on the control of morbidity due to schistosomiasis using preventive chemotherapy with praziquantel. A paradigm shift occurred in recent years - the declared goal is to eliminate schistosomiasis as a public health problem and to interrupt transmission in selected areas by 2025. However, challenges occur on ""the last mile"" and novel tools and an evidence-based strategy are required for breaking the transmission of schistosomiasis. Goal and specific aims: The overarching goal of my research proposal is to provide an evidence-base that schistosomiasis elimination is feasible within 3 years, if multi-disciplinary intervention packages, readily tailored to social-ecological settings, are employed. The three specific aims that will be addressed are:  Determine the impact of a novel multi-disciplinary intervention package for interrupting urogenital schistosomiasis transmission in remaining hotspots in Zanzibar. Investigate an innovative surveillance-response package for preventing resurgence of urogenital schistosomiasis transmission in no/low-endemic areas. Exploit an innovative package of diagnostics to determine research outcomes in a changing endemic landscape.  Methods: I will apply and optimize interdisciplinary approaches and methods, including the combination of medical, environmental and behavioural interventions, and a broad set of classical parasitological and modern antigen-based or molecular diagnostic tests in the North of Pemba Island, Zanzibar, Tanzania, which, together, will break the transmission of schistosomiasis. Expected results: Over the 3 years of rigorously applying tailored multi-disciplinary interventions with a high coverage in a persistent hotspot area, I expect a significant decrease in the Schistosoma haematobium prevalence and infection intensity down to an incidence of zero. Tailored surveillance-response in low-endemic areas will be a cost-effective approach accepted by the local communities for preventing resurgence of transmission. The prevalence and incidence in formerly low-endemic areas will be reduced to zero. Intermediate host snails present at human water contact sites will not be infected with and transmit S. haematobium anymore. The knowledge about schistosomiasis transmission and prevention and the risk behaviour in the targeted population will have improved significantly. The new point-of-care circulating anodic antigen (POC-CAA) rapid diagnostic test will be an easy to use and highly sensitive and specific method for S. haematobium infection monitoring and surveillance in the field. To confirm interruption of transmission, molecular or antigen-based techniques will be needed. Impact: This research will influence guidelines for schistosomiasis elimination and inform scientists, disease control programme managers and policy makers. It fills a critical global health knowledge gap, with findings transferable to different settings and across a range of NTDs that are targeted for elimination. Finally, schistosomiasis diagnostics validated in real-world settings will be useful in Europe, particularly among migrants and asylum seekers from Africa.","Behaviour change, Control, Elimination, Helminth, Mass drug administration, Snail control, Urogenital schistosomiasis",external_funding,Active,4483716,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,342,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"De Luca, Marta",NA,Faculty of Science; Departement Physik / Physik; Departement Physik / Experimental Material Physics (Zardo),Quantum structures in nanowires: physical properties on demand by hydrogen irradiation,2018,"Nanowires (NWs) are filamentary crystals with diameters of tens of nanometers and several microns in length. The great interest attracted by semiconductor NWs has been triggered by the growing demand for compact and powerful nanoscale devices, where NWs may act as both interconnects and functionalized components. A lot of emphasis in today research in NWs is put on the engineering of complex quantum structures in NWs, for they encode new functionalities and/or enhance existing performances. This project aims at developing unexplored strategies for embedding site-controlled quantum structures in III-V NWs and at finding fast and effective routes to engineer the physical properties of NWs. The pursued routes will involve mainly post-growth hydrogen implantation, thus allowing to achieve different NW properties on demand with no need to change and re-optimize NW growth conditions. Remarkably, the changes in the NW properties will be reversible, as hydrogen can be removed by thermal or laser annealing. Hydrogen is a ubiquitous, highly mobile, and reactive impurity able to passivate most deep and shallow defects purposely or accidentally embedded in semiconductor crystals, and it is present in most steps of semiconductor growth and device processing. In this project, controlled low-energy H+ incorporation will be performed on single NWs and large NW arrays. Among all hydrogen effects, two striking effects well known for bulk samples will be investigated and engineered in the field of NWs: the band gap opening in InN and In-rich InGaN, and the passivation of N atoms in dilute nitrides III-N-V semiconductors such as GaAsN and GaPN. The unique growth environment offered by NWs will allow to benefit from a much greater flexibility with respect to conventional, planar, epitaxial growth, owing to the seamlessly enhanced ability of NWs to accommodate elastic strain and to host even lattice-mismatched material combinations. A variety of quantum structures in NWs will be achieved within this project, mostly but not only by using hydrogenation: quantum dots, quantum wires, quantum rings, quantum well tubes, and quantum wells. The structural characterization of the NWs will be coupled to optical spectroscopy techniques (inelastic light scattering and photoluminescence), also under intense magnetic fields and in a time-resolved regime. The experimental studies will be complemented by a robust theoretical support. In this way, a full picture of the electronic, optical, magnetic, and thermal properties of the quantum structures in NWs will be achieved and controllably tuned. The strength of the proposed approach will be proven by obtaining NWs with desired magnetic, photonic, and thermoelectric properties: in quantum rings and tubes, magnetic states that should appear due to the circular symmetry of their carrier wavefunction will be probed for the first time; in quantum dots deterministically positioned in NWs, single photon emission and enhanced light extraction will be achieved in prototypical light emitting devices; in NWs with embedded (non-)periodic superlattices of quantum dots and quantum wells, an enhancement of the thermoelectric power factor and thus of the thermoelectric figure of merit will be pursued. Moreover, potential uses in other fields, including photovoltaics and quantum sensing are envisioned. In this project, fundamental scientific investigation and technological applications will be strongly entangled and benefit from each other, as many advanced functionalities are deeply rooted in the way physical laws work in the nanoscale realm.","Semiconductor nanowires, Quantum confinement, Raman spectroscopy, Photoluminescence spectroscopy, Hydrogen irradiation, Photonics, Thermoelectrics, Magnetic states",external_funding,Active,4483730,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,343,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"Freytag, Virginie",NA,Departement Psychologie / Molecular Psychology (Papassotiropoulos),Identification of molecular patterns linked to human memory,2018,"Increasing evidence points to the role of the immune system in regulation of memory processes. A recent study conducted by our group notably described a link between peripheral epigenetic markers with cortical thickness measures and memory. The molecular mechanisms underlying immune-memory relationship remain yet elusive. In this project we proposed to further investigate this link by capitalizing on recent well-powered human genetic studies of a wide range of peripheral immune related traits. Specifically, we relied on this unprecedented resource and a behavioral-imaging genetic data of a maximum N=1,625 healthy young subjects to (i) investigate the relationships between cortical thickness, episodic memory (EM) and a panel of ~200 immune-related traits (ii) identify which subset of molecular markers contribute significantly to these relationships, and (iii) explore their molecular profiles in whole-blood. In a first phase, we performed exhaustive hypothesis-free association testing between ~200 blood measures derived polygenic risk scores (PRS) and brain related traits. This yielded to the identification of a significant correlation (r = -0.12, FDR &lt;0.05) between peripheral Acetate derived PRS, and a regional thickness pattern characterized by a circumscribed set of regions including the entorhinal cortices and temporal poles. This first result suggests existence of shared genetic contributions between levels of Acetate in blood and variability in cortical thickness, in regions known to be relevant to EM function. Downstream functional annotation analyses yet didn't allow the identification of specific molecular patterns robustly linking Acetate levels to cortical thickness in our study population. In a second phase of the project, we capitalized on recently published large-scale GWAS on neuropsychiatric disorders, to further target specific blood related traits amenable to downstream analysis. Specifically, relying on genetic correlation method, we identified significant negative relationship between both schizophrenia (SCZ) and major depression (MDD), and Citrate levels (SCZ: r = -021, p = 7e-4; MDD: r = -0.21, p= 2.5e-3). Both disorders being characterized by deficits in EM performance, Citrate levels derived PRS was tested for association with EM performance in our study sample. This yielded a significant positive correlation (r = 0.06, p = 0.02), replicated in a second independent sample comprising N=1,851 healthy young adults (r = 0.05, p = 0.02). Downstream functional annotation of traits associated markers, led to the identification of GRAMD1A - a gene encoding for GRAM domain containing 1A protein involved in cholesterol homeostasis - showing simultaneously significant association with Citrate levels and EM performance. In addition, we identified a total of 15 individual CpG sites at which estimated DNAm in whole-blood showed significant correlation with Citrate levels. This result suggests that genetic markers might partially exert their effect on Citrate levels through whole-blood DNAm, although none of these sites showed robust association with EM performance in our study sample. In sum, Citrate levels, which are genetically linked to schizophrenia and major depressive disorder, showed a significant genetic correlation with EM performance in our study population comprising heathy young adults. Functional annotation of genetic markers further pointed to GRAMD1A as linked to both EM performance and citrate levels. It remains though unclear whether the identified genetic contributions do overlap with genetic contributions linking Citrate to MDD or SCZ, or represent independent genetic factors. Hence, these results warrant independent replication before considering downstream functional validation.",NA,external_funding,Completed,4479244,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,344,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Sorafenib is the first approved targeted therapeutic agent for advanced HCC. Although sorafenib increases overall survival in patients with advanced stage HCC, the response rate is poor, with only 2% of the patients achieving partial response and 71% achieving stable disease, and no specific genetic alterations have been associated with the resistance to sorafenib in HCC to date. Moreover, large-scale massively parallel sequencing studies of HCCs suggest that HCCs are almost completely devoid of highly recurrent targetable genetic alterations. While patients undergo sorafenib treatment, the standard modality of disease monitoring is imaging. However, imaging does not inform the molecular changes in the tumors nor can it identify alternative molecular targets for therapy.   Concentration of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has been suggested as a potential diagnostic tool for HCC in combination with serum alpha-fetoprotein. Fluctuations in cfDNA levels and the presence of HCC-associated somatic genetic alterations in the cfDNA have been associated with disease burden. These clinical associations suggest that cfDNA may be a minimally invasive tool to monitor response to sorafenib and may also serve as a surrogate to identify additional targetable genetic alterations, currently only possible by invasive biopsies of the primary tumors. Given the advancements in massively parallel sequencing technologies that have enabled us to perform systematic genetic characterization from minute amounts of DNA and the successful proof-of-principle studies performed in other cancer types, we hypothesize that plasma-derived cfDNA may be useful as a non-invasive tool to track the evolution of HCCs and to monitor the HCC in patients undergoing sorafenib treatment. To address these hypotheses, we will perform target capture massively parallel sequencing using a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified clinical sequencing assay and digital droplet PCR on the DNA extracted from the primary liver lesion and synchronously collected plasma-derived cfDNA prior to the initiation of sorafenib and after 6 months of sorafenib in 10 prospectively accrued patients with advanced HCC.   We aim to 1) to determine if cfDNA captures the genetic alterations of therapy-naïve primary HCC and 2) to determine whether cfDNA mimics the clonal evolution of the primary tumor over the course of sorafenib. We expect that these experiments and analyses will provide evidence on the feasibility of using cfDNA as a non-invasive approach to molecularly monitor disease progression in patients undergoing sorafenib treatment and to detect genetic alterations that may serve as additional options for targeted therapy.  ",NA,external_funding,Completed,4479245,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,345,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

This, however, requires implementation of inexpensive and environmentally friendly materials into solar cells. In this regard, organic materials offer the solution because they can be produced cheaply on a large scale. The problem with organic photovoltaic devices is, however, their low power conversion efficiency, which is a consequence of the short exciton-diffusion lengths and imbalanced charge transport in organic materials with lower mobility of electrons than that of holes. Simultaneously, the best performing electron-transporting materials in organic solar cells, namely, fullerenes, absorb visible light poorly, are hard to modify, and expensive to produce. In this research proposal, the synthesis and experimental investigation of molecular nanoprisms with built-in visible-light absorbing molecular electron acceptors as their triangular base is described. The symmetric spatial arrangement of the molecular electron acceptor units, their mutual distance and orientation in these nanoprisms will allow for extensive radial electron delocalization and, consequently, for efficient charge separation in an active layer of a solar cell. The possibility of the controlled growth of the nanoprisms by well-defined synthetic methods permits to incorporate various combinations of donor-acceptor motifs into the nanoprisms to tune their photophysical and redox properties. The unique three-dimensional shape and the aspect ratio of these nanoprisms will allow them to efficiently transport electrons in the materials incorporating them. Such favorable properties of these molecules will, one day, allow to make efficient organic solar cells competitive with other photovoltaic technologies.","organic solar cells, fullerenes, molecular nanoprisms, electron acceptor, perylene bisimide, charge separation",external_funding,Completed,4479260,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,346,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

The two geographical areas chosen for the project were frontier region of the Roman Empire and were later located at the core of the Carolingian Empire. Research in different European regions during this period suggests that changes in the orientation and scale of husbandry practices reflect different socio-political conditions and economic strategies. Roman husbandry practices are known to have impacted considerably on the way domestic animals were raised in the various provinces of the Empire, in relation to a high degree of specialization of economic activities. The decline of the Roman political and economic structures and the development of feudal socio-economic structures had important consequences in animal husbandry practices, mainly in relation to the end of market-oriented production, and they include a self-subsistence economy, limited livestock mobility, no genetic improvement of livestock, and changes in management practices. The project looks at the reasons, timings and regional variations in the response (resilience or adaptation) of animal husbandry practices to the socio-political changes, including the progressive diversification of the production, the decrease of livestock size, the generalization of extensive or free range feeding regimes, and the limited mobility of livestock. For this, the project undertakes a thorough investigation of livestock body size and shape; integrates the zooarchaeological data with stable isotope analysis to investigate changes in the ways livestock was managed; and strives to understand the archaeological and regional variability of the consequences of the collapse of the Roman Empire and of the gradual process that led to the birth of medieval economies.","zooarchaeology, economy, Roman period, Early Middle Ages, limes, Rhine",external_funding,Completed,4462401,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,347,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Livestock animals and farming innovations are thought to have spread across Europe during the Neolithic period via two distinct dispersal routes: 1. along the Danubecorridor and through central Europe and 2. along the Mediterranean coast. This resulted in two distinctive cultural areas linked with particular modes of animal husbandry; a central European area with cultures based on cattle herding, and aMediterranean area with cultures based on caprine husbandry. These husbandry patterns became embedded in these regions and remained the focus of agricultural practices into the Bronze Age and beyond. Switzerland is located betweenthese two geographical and cultural regions and the Neolithic and Bronze Age cultures here represent a rare meeting and interaction point between them, yet very little work has explored the nature of this. Switzerland also has many largeassemblages of perfectly preserved faunal remains from prehistoric lake dwelling sites where precise dating of different settlement phases can be achieved, representing a rare opportunity for the study of human-animal interactions with incredible temporal precision.The LAKEBOS project will use cattle, the most common domestic species at Swiss prehistoric sites, and a vital part of the new Neolithic farming 'package', as a proxy for investigating the way in which prehistoric agricultural practices from centralEuropean and Mediterranean cultures passed through this region and interacted with each other.

It will also use ancient DNA to investigate the potential for the introduction of new cattle groups into the region.

Adult V-SVZ NSC are highly heterogeneous. Stem cells co-exist in quiescent and activated states and reside in regionally-distinct V-SVZ domains and produce different subtypes of olfactory bulb neurons and glia. However, whether this heterogeneity is due to intrinsic fate commitment or whether it is dynamically responsive to external changes is still debated. Moreover, the mechanisms that modulate the balance between activation and dormancy are largely unknown. It is emerging that physiological states modulate V-SVZ cell behaviour and impact adult neurogenesis. We propose to investigate whether physiologically distinct states result in the recruitment of regionally distinct pools of adult V-SVZ neural stem cells.

DM1 patients display muscle wasting, weakness and inability to relax (i.e. myotonia). DM1 is an autosomal dominant disease caused by an expanded CTG triplet repeat located in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK (Dystrophia myotonica protein kinase) gene. Hairpins formed by the transcribed abnormal CUG repeats lead to the sequestration of splicing factors, such as MBNL1, and thereby to mis-splicing of different genes, which constitutes the primary cause for the multisystemic defects in DM1. In particular, missplicing of the CLCN1 gene, encoding chloride channel 1, is thought to be responsible for the pathological delayed relaxation of skeletal muscle in patients. Although different strategies have been tested to limit splicing defects in DM1 cells, no causal treatment is available for this disabling disease. Recently, we established that the metabolic pathways, AMPK and mTORC1, are deregulated in DM1 muscle,which likely contributes to muscle dysfunction. In particular, we showed that treating HSALR mice, a well-known mouse model for DM1, with rapamycin (to inhibit TORC1) or with AICAR (to activate AMPK) drastically reduces myotonia in these mice. AICAR treatment led to the disassembly of nuclear foci and the release of MBLN1, and it reduced mis-splicing of Clcn1. In contrast, rapamycin treatment did not change Clcn1 splicing in HSALR mice, pointing to alternative compensatory processes improving muscle relaxation. In parallel, we recently observed that neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) are perturbed in HSALR muscle, which may be related to the deregulation of metabolic pathways and/or of calcium signaling and may contribute to muscle alterations in DM1. The overall aim of this project is to better understand the pathomechanisms leading to muscle dysfunction in DM1 and to identify strategies liable to reverse muscle alterations in the disease. More specifically, we aim 1) to decipher novel processes contributing to myotonia in DM1, 2) to unveil splicing-dependent and -independent mechanisms limiting myotonia in DM1 muscle, and 3) to explore NMJ perturbations in DM1 and their contribution to the disease. To this purpose, the experimental approaches will include an extensive analysis of myotonia, missplicing events, foci stability, transcriptional changes, channel properties and sub-cellular trafficking of RNAbinding proteins, as well as a comprehensive investigation on activity-dependent signaling and muscle response to changes in neural activity in mouse models for DM1. The project will provide essential insights on the mechanisms at play in muscle dysfunction in DM1 pathology and on the molecular processes, which may limit the extent of this disabling pathology.

Despite advances in many fields of medicine, there is still a relevant risk of death related to these operations. Depending on how sick the patient was prior to the operation and the type of the operation needed, between 1% and 10% of patients die within 30 days of an operation. Cardiac complications, including a heart attack, occurring either during or immediately after these operations seem to be important contributors to many of these deaths.Most heart attacks occurring during or immediately after an operation do not cause symptoms such as chest pain, as the patients is receiving high doses of anesthetic drugs at this time. Accordingly, these heart attacks are very often missed in clinical routine. Therefore, it is largely unknown how often these heart attacks occur and for how many of the perioperative deaths these heart attacks are responsible for.Also, it is unknown, why these heart attacks occur during or immediately after an operation and how these patients should be treated.Aims: To find out, how common cardiac complications including heart attacks are during or immediately after an operation, for how many of the perioperative deaths these heart attacks are responsible for,why these heart attacks occur, how these patients should be treated.Methodology: 3460 consecutive patients undergoing a major operation will be included into this pragmatic prospective observational multicentre study at the University Hospital Basel, the Cantonal Hospital Aarau, and other hospitals in Switzerland. The study will be conducted by an interdisciplinary team of cardiology, anaesthesiology, and surgery. Patients will receive measurements of a novel blood tests that allows the rapid detection of dying heart muscle cells, and therefore heart attacks. prior to the operation, as well as after the operation. The type and the most likely cause of these heart attacks will then by examined by experienced physicians. We will contact all patients after hospital discharge and check whether they are fine or whether a complications or even death may have occurred. We will then try to develop tools that allow a more precise assessment of the risk in the individual patient developing such a cardiac complication and/or death.Potential Significance: Our large interdisciplinary multicentre project will provide novel and unique insights on heart attacks occurring during or immediately after an operation. These insights will empower physicians and patients to make better assessment of the risk-benefit ratio of a planned operation.

Building on the emergent literature on affective citizenship that highlights the role of affect and emotions in the relationship between states and citizens, this project examines religious incorporation as an affective citizenship regime in which not only religious rights but also political belonging is being negotiated. In public debates about whether or not Islam belongs to Europe, it often goes unnoticed that all states in Western Europe with significant Muslim populations have already modified their existing regulations and laws to various degrees in order to accommodate religious difference after migration. While naturalization rates and the level of political enfranchisement remain low among Muslim migrants, the degree of their religious incorporation has accelerated considerably. Moreover, both in official migration policy and in migrant claim making, the focus has gravitated from political to religious incorporation. Literature in the social sciences has engaged with the legal integration of Islam mostly in terms of political opportunity structures for Muslims, or as a source of conflict and tension with European values and society. Yet there is no research on the motivations for the increasing recognition claims or on the effects of religious incorporation for political belonging. This project studies the religious incorporation of Muslims in European states at local or national levels and asks a) how citizenship is negotiated by state and Muslim community actors through the process of religious incorporation, and b) if and how religious incorporation affects their feeling of belonging to the states in which they live. With a comparison of the religious incorporation process of two antagonistic religious communities from Turkey-Alevis and Sunni Muslims-in Switzerland, Germany, and Austria, the project seeks to present nuanced insights that accounts for the heterogeneity of Muslim claim makers. The project proposes that in the process of the legal integration of Islam in Europe, Alevis have emerged as desirable subjects of the integrating state-quite in contrast to Sunni Muslims, whose compatibility with European values remains contested. The project examines how religious incorporation of both Alevi and Sunni communities are responding to the various forms and degrees of recognition, asking if it informs their political belonging or not. The research contains three subprojects. The first subproject documents and analyses the legal integration process of Alevis in Europe in eleven countries, where Alevis have formed communities and processes of recognition have been initiated. This will fill an important empirical research gap, as no encompassing account of the institutional integration of Alevism in Europe exists. The methods entail qualitative fieldwork with expert interviews and document analysis. The second subproject analyses the effects of religious incorporation on political belonging by conducting an ethnographic fieldwork in three cities, where Alevi and Sunni communities have been incorporated to varying degrees (Basel, Hamburg, Vienna). The third subproject examines in detail three incorporation processes (Basel, Hamburg, Vienna) as an affective citizenship regime, in which both states and claim makers are negotiating the terms of belonging to secular democracies. The research contributes both the theoretical enhancement of the emergent field of affective citizenship and the wider literature on accommodation of Islam that has focused so far mainly on the majority denomination.

Despite the available evidence on the association of AF with stroke and systemic embolism, the underlying mechanisms of thrombogenesis with regard to rhythm and/or other factors are largely unknown. If the presence of AF per se is the main reason for thrombus formation, more AF episodes should result in more strokes. There is at least some evidence that non-paroxysmal AF is associated with a higher risk of stroke. However, the temporal relationship of AF episodes with the occurrence of strokes has been questioned. Therefore, the significance of AF burden, defined as the percentage of time in AF and its changes over time are currently largely unknown.Aims: The aim of this study is to increase our knowledge on the association between AF burden and its health consequences, mainly stroke/systemic embolism and cognitive dysfunction. Methodology: Patients from the SNSF funded Swiss-AF cohort study with paroxysmal and persistent AF will be asked to participate in the study. Based on 1) an enrollment rate of 40% of all Swiss-AF patients with paroxysmal and persistent AF (according to a pilot study), and 2) the participation of the top enrolling centers, it is expected to enroll 460 patients. All patients will get a 7-day Holter electrocardiogram (ECG), in order to assess the AF burden. The 7-day Holter ECG will be repeated after one year. A subsample of 100 patients will additionally get an implantable loop recorder to monitor their cardiac rhythm continuously over two years. Measurement of AF burden will be performed using an automated AF episode detection algorithm and manual validation. In addition to the cardiac monitoring, these patients will get a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging to assess cardiac structure and function at baseline. All other characteristics (clinical information, blood samples, brain MRI) and follow-up information are available within the Swiss-AF cohort. Potential Significance: This multicenter interdisciplinary project will provide novel and unique insights on the association of directly measured AF burden and its consequences. Whereas the infrastructure cohort grant Swiss-AF covers important variables including validated outcome events and an established biobank in a large number of AF patients, the association of AF with stroke and other brain lesions is currently limited by the fact that AF burden is not quantified and that information on cardiac function is not assessed systematically in our patient population.

The three main schistosome species parasitizing humans are Schistosoma haematobium, S. mansoni and S. japonicum. In a restricted geographical focus in Cambodia and Laos, S. mekongi occurs. Schistosomiasis is responsible for a global burden of 2.6 million disability-adjusted life years. The standard treatment used against schistosomiasis is praziquantel, a safe and efficacious drug that is, however, not without drawbacks. For instance, praziquantel is active against adult schistosomes, but has no or only very little activity against young developmental stages of the parasite. Additionally, the high drug pressure from the widespread use of praziquantel could lead to drug resistance, which would jeopardize the global control strategy against schistosomiasis, as there are no marketed alternatives to praziquantel. Hence, there is a pressing need to develop novel antischistosomal drugs. Unfortunately though, neglected disease markets are non-commercial, therefore drug companies are not interested in them. Moreover, there are only very few academic research groups working on anthelminthic drug discovery. The single exception in the field of antischistosomal drug development is a consortium that aims to develop a paediatric formulation (oral dispersible tablet (ODT)) of praziquantel based on the enantiomer or the racemate.The aim of my 4-year research project is to identify one or several antischistosomal drug development candidates targeting the haemoglobin degradation pathway and/or other mechanisms with favourable physico-chemical and drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (DMPK) properties. My proposed research will assist in improving current treatment options for schistosomiasis (and other trematodiases, such as opisthorchiasis). To accomplish this aim, I will pursue four specific objectives:i.To assess the in vitro activity of analogues of selected lead compounds against larval (schistosomula) and adult S. mansoni and assess cytotoxicity and metabolic stability.ii.To elucidate and characterize in vivo efficacy of lead compounds in schistosome-rodent models.iii.To determine pharmacokinetic parameters for the most potent compounds.iv.To determine the activity, safety and pharmacokinetics of escalating dosages of a new ODT of praziquantel in preschool-aged children infected with S. haematobium in Côte d'Ivoire and S. mekongi (and Opisthorchis viverrini) in Laos.Antischistosomal drug discovery suggested in this proposal will be done in close collaboration with Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) and Prof. Kelly Chibale in South Africa.

While this is accepted, insight into how the different layers of genome regulation co-operate has remained poor. The discovery of active DNA demethylation, which can occur through a process of 5mC oxidation by TET proteins and replacement of the oxidized 5mC by TDG-dependent base excision repair (BER), has added another piece to the puzzle. We contributed to and followed up on this discovery to delineate the mode of action of TET-TDG-BER-mediated DNA demethylation and to investigate its biological function. This revealed that certain genomic loci undergo continuous DNA repair-mediated demethylation, providing a conceptual framework to link DNA demethylation with nucleosomal dynamics. DNA repair processes inherently have dynamic properties as they entail opening, editing and re-synthesizing DNA, events that involve signaling to chromatin. Indeed, transcriptional activation and cellular reprogramming have been associated with the formation of DNA single strand-breaks (SSBs) and the engagement of BER proteins (XRCC1, PAPR1), consistent with DNA SSB formation and repair contributing to the establishment and/or maintenance of a permissive chromatin state. Prompted by such observations, we investigated the hypothesis that DNA demethylation operates to target DNA SSBs to genomic sites where epigenetic plasticity is to be established or maintained. This project is a refined approach to address the following hypothesis. TET-TDG-BER mediated DNA demethylation plays an active role in regulating chromatin accessibility at enhancers and gene promoters. Changes in chromatin accessibility are achieved (i) by modulation of linker histone H1 association, whereby DNA repair activity associated with DNA demethylation (NPM1, NPM3, PARP) plays an active role and facilitates the establishment of enhancer-promoter loops, and (ii) by changes in histone modification, facilitated by TET-TDG dependent modulation of MLL and PRC2 activities. Research towards the following objectives is pursued to address this hypothesis Objective 1: Deciphering the role of nucleophosmin in TET-TDG-dependent regulation of chromatin accessibility.

"Banfi, Andrea",NA,Departement Biomedizin / Cell and Gene Therapy (Banfi),Decoding the molecular regulation of intussusceptive angiogenesis for therapeutic targeting,2018,"Background. Ischemic cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in the Western world and, despite advances in medical and surgical therapy, the morbidity and mortality remain very high. Therapeutic angiogenesis aims to induce the formation of new blood vessels to improve the perfusion of ischemic tissue in patients with end-stage coronary artery or peripheral arterial disease that are not amenable to other treatment options. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A (VEGF) is the master regulator of vascular growth and it has been tested clinically with a variety of delivery methods. However, the results of placebo-controlled clinical trials have been disappointing and yielded mostly negative results. Retrospective analyses showed that the effects of VEGF can be deleterious if uncontrolled, and achieving therapeutic efficacy with VEGF gene delivery at safe vector doses has proven particularly challenging, despite the exquisite biological potency of the factor. Therefore, there is a clear need to better understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating vascular growth under therapeutically relevant conditions of VEGF delivery. Rationale. We previously found that VEGF induces normal or aberrant angiogenesis depending on its concentration in the microenvironment around each producing cell in vivo, rather than on the total delivered dose. Our results in the previous funding period show that: 1) VEGF delivery to skeletal muscle at therapeutically relevant doses induces angiogenesis by the mechanism of intussusception rather than by the well-studied process of sprouting; and 2) the regulation of VEGF-induced intussusceptive angiogenesis is likely fundamentally different from that of sprouting, with divergent therapeutic consequences. Yet, the molecular mechanisms of intussusception remain poorly understood compared to the regulation of sprouting, mainly due to a paucity of appropriate models. Specific aims. Here we propose to systematically investigate the molecular regulation of intussusceptive angiogenesis in skeletal muscle (the tissue affected by peripheral artery disease) under therapeutically relevant conditions of angiogenic factor delivery. Specifically, we aim to: 1) establish a platform for high-resolution in vivo imaging of intussusceptive angiogenesis in skeletal muscle by 2-photon microscopy; 2) systematically investigate its molecular regulation by a stage-specific and VEGF dose-dependent unbiased analysis of the vascular transcriptome; and 3) elucidate the function of the identified signaling pathways by loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments. Experimental design. Monoclonal populations of retrovirally transduced myoblast, which homogeneously secrete different amounts of VEGF, or a highly controlled fibrin-based platform for protein delivery, will be used to deliver specific VEGF doses in skeletal muscle.

Thanks to the progress achieved in recombinant protein expression and evolution, artificial metalloproteins offer an attractive means to complement or substitute natural enzymes. Building on the group's expertize in the design and optimization of artificial metalloenzymes, this proposal sets out develop artificial monooxygenases based on the biotin-streptavidin technology. This work complements our work on C-H activation relying on Rh-based artificial metalloenzymes (Hyster et. al., Science 2012, 338, 500). The field of bioinorganic chemistry has developed a handful of nitrogen-based small coordination compounds containing earth-abundant metals that, in combination with hydrogen peroxide, have been used for the oxidation of hydrocarbons. Building on this, we will prepare a series of iron- and manganese complexes bearing biotinylated tetradentate aminopyridine ligands. Their activity will be screened in the presence of streptavidin. A chemo-genetic optimization strategy will be initially applied to improve the performance of the artificial monooxygenases. For this purpose, a series of model alkanes and alkyl ethers with increasing C-H bond dissociation energies will be screened using a 96-well plate format. Next, it is proposed to implement an E. coli surface display of streptavidin to significantly increase the throughput of the directed evolution effort. Here, we will rely on a fluorescence-activated droplet sorting high-throughput screen using coumarin methyl-ether as pro-fluorescent substrate. With the aim of exploiting artificial monooxygenases for the late-stage functionalization of complex molecules, we will subsequently evolve the regioselectivity of the most promising biohybrids.

This kind of concern now looms large in philosophy, as there has been a marked turn to questions of how we can improve rather than just describe our conceptual practices. This turn has involved a radical break with Wittgensteinian ideas. While Wittgenstein has convinced many that we should not seek to derive the one definitively right set of concepts from timeless rational foundations, what he advocates instead has widely been felt to be overly conservative: he insists that justifications come to an end in the ""bedrock of practice,"" that we should defer to the practices we find ourselves with. Many have concluded from this that Wittgensteinianism inevitably leads to a conservative or Right Wittgensteinianism. Contemporary approaches seeking to improve our concepts try to break free from Wittgensteinian conservatism by breaking free from Wittgensteinianism. Yet this total abandonment of Wittgensteinian insights introduces fresh failings. One contemporary approach, conceptual engineering, takes progress through conceptual innovation in science as its model and seeks to forge new concepts in order to ask better questions; but it suffers from a tendency to treat the motley of our practices as something that can be designed from the philosopher's drawing board, like artificial languages in logic. Similarly, the ameliorative metaphysics approach seeks to decide which (if any) of the warring conceptions of concepts like human nature we should use by appealing to ethical and political criteria; but it remains overly abstract in asking whether we should use any of these conceptions tout court, thereby overlooking the needs in actual situations from which each of these conceptions might derive a point in practice. These are failings which Wittgensteinian attention to what our concepts do for us in practice can remedy. What is needed is a middle path between Right Wittgensteinianism and the revisionary approaches. The long-term aim of this project is to trace such a middle path between Wittgensteinian conservatism and more revisionary approaches by developing a LeftWittgensteinian Framework that combines the revisionary ambitions of conceptual engineering and ameliorative metaphysics-hence ""Left""-with Wittgensteinian attention to the point of our concepts given our needs in actual situations-hence ""Wittgensteinian.""

MACQSIMAL will combine state-of-the-art sensor physics with the MEMS atomic vapor cell platform, for highly advanced prototypes and demonstrators. Concurrently, advanced squeezing, entanglement and cavity-QED methods will be applied for the first time in miniaturized sensors, bringing quantum enhancement closer than ever to industrial application.

Within the relational paradigm of traditional databases, it has been extremely challenging to map complex intertextual references. Thanks to new information technologies, we can offer a generic digital framework for representing interrelated information which overcomes these limitations. The collaborative and competitive canon of the London theatre scene around 1600 will serve as a ""real world"" example of relations between multiple texts.WordWeb/IDEM's main objectives will significantly advance Digital Humanities and the study of early modern literature. (1) To develop and implement WordWeb, a software framework which can model complex intertextual relationships in any cultural domain. (2) To harness 200 years of research for an unprecedented overview of Intertextuality in Drama of the Early Modern Period (IDEM).(3) To clarify Shakespeare's contribution to the overall ""web of words"" of his time.The project builds on experience gained from the HyperHamlet database (SNF Project Passages We Live By 2006-2010), a hypertext of Shakespeare's tragedy in which each line gives access to texts in which that line is quoted. In contrast, WordWeb/IDEM will make cross-references between the works of dozens of dramatists visible as an extended verbal and social network. WordWeb can renew our vision of intertextuality through a ground-breaking new paradigm for representing what is conventionally called ""quotation"". Instead of complete texts, Word-Web/IDEM will store only intertextually active passages, i.e. phrases which have been identified in more than one text. These items are not seen as deriving from a famous masterpiece. Instead, they represent much-quoted phrases which just happen to occur also in Hamlet, for example. The name ""WordWeb"" indicates this new focus: short verbal items (""Word"") are connected to each other by rich links that carry bibliographical information and other annotations (""Web""). By storing only shared passages, WordWeb/IDEM will have room for an open number of texts that quote and are quoted and so present an extensive overview of the verbal network of Renais-sance drama. Such a coherent view is urgently needed. Thousands of references between Elizabe-than and Jacobean plays are lost from view because they are reported in hard-to-access footnotes, indexes and detailed studies. WordWeb/IDEM will make this extremely valuable, extremely specific data accessible and set them in context. A digital ""semantic web"" with sophisticated options for visualization will relate older, philological research to recent digital investigations and set Shakespeare's works in the context of his contemporaries. As a result, connections and influences will emerge that have remained invisible because of fragmented research. IDEM's multidimensional map of the dense tissue of verbal ""memes"" in early modern drama will revolutionize our under-standing of one of the most significant bodies of English literature.

Systemic Salmonella enterica infections are a major cause of mortality worldwide 1-5, and become increasingly untreatable 6,7. Our single-cell data show in a mouse model that the host immune system actually eradicates many Salmonella cells, while other Salmonella thrive at the same time in the same tissue, causing lethal disease progression 8,9. Emerging evidence suggests that similar heterogeneous host-pathogen encounters might be a key feature of many infectious diseases 10-20. This heterogeneity offers fascinating opportunities for research and application. If we understand the mechanisms that determine the disparate local outcomes, we might be able to tip the balance in favor of the host, by closing permissive niches in which pathogens can thrive. Current research mostly relies on snapshots that cannot capture the crucial temporal dynamics. We know that Salmonella cells differentially access host nutrients, experience oxidative or nitrosative stress, etc.; but what is the consequence of these encounters and what impact do they have for overall disease outcome? We detect many dead Salmonella cells in tissues; but which events led to their killing, and why did this not happen to the thriving Salmonella subset? Our goals are, therefore, to track Salmonella cells that have experienced a specific host encounter, to manipulate their fate, and to elucidate underlying mechanisms in vivo. To achieve these goals, we will follow four specific aims, in which we test eight specific hypotheses:  To unravel encounter consequences over the first few divisions (6-36 h). We will exploit a fluorescent TIMER reporter variant with very slow color maturation as a novel tool. To unravel encounter consequences over several days. We will link Salmonella subset-specific promoters with genetic switches and reporters useful for lineage tracing. To determine the impact of specific encounters for overall disease outcome. We will deplete Salmonella in defined encounters using suicide lysis and/or DNA damage. To determine the underlying molecular mechanisms. We will correlate local abundance of host factors with key encounter types and validate causal relationships using perturbations.  Combination of these innovative approaches with our recently developed 3D imaging technique for whole spleen will enable us to validate, improve, and extend our spatio-temporal model for Salmonella infection dynamics. This will be a key step for translating the increasingly detailed knowledge about Salmonella and host heterogeneity during infection, into new strategies for controlling life-threatening systemic Salmonella infections.

In this way, clinical experts are relieved of this laborious activity.While domain transfer has previously been used to highlight disease effects in medical images, to the best of our knowledge, no one has tried to distinguish explicitly between (1) what visually characterizes pathology and (2) where it occurs, as is done by our approach.In the best case, our setup will render manual segmen-tations obsolete, not only for training but also for actual application of the framework. Potentially, its results may even help finding new visual manifestations of pathology that have previously been overlooked.We hypothesize that detecting manifestations of pathology can be learned given two unpaired sets of images, one showing healthy and one showing diseased subjects, by automatically finding the visual clues that make pathological regions stand out.In particular, we aim at modeling the difference between the domains of healthy and pathological images: We will train an artificial neural network to transfer an image from the pathological to the healthy domain by (1) ""filling in"" and (2) marking the regions that need to be altered to make the generated result appear healthy.We plan to train and evaluate our approach on different types of pathology, using publicly available data.

Confronted with the fact that such forms of computer-based text analysis can be effective even in the absence of any expert knowledge about the make-up of texts, researchers in humanities need to be open not only to the adoption of new technologies in their research, but also to self-reflection (e.g., Dewey, 1964). Given its position at the intersection between technological and humanistic research traditions, Digital Humanities in particular has a responsibility and an interest to critically assess its own practices. In this vein, our research project addresses distinct research methodologies as well as the epistemic dimension of textual Digital Humanities. In two aligned case studies that combine machine learning applications of sentiment detection with more traditional manual and semi-automatic text analysis, such as close reading and annotation, we study evaluative language use in web 2.0 discourses as an example of text production in the context of digitization. Our practical aim in these case studies is to examine how available dictionaries, algorithms, and machine learning procedures work on two sets of German textual data extracted from the social web, travel blogs (travelblog.org) and literature reviews (lovelybooks.de). Addressing the question of how users convey their evaluation of journeys and books, we on the one hand find and generate sets of answers to the question itself using traditional humanities and machine learning approaches (level 0), and on the other hand shed light on the role of the distinct research epistemologies as well as our own research practices and attitudes which frame or even shape our findings (level 1).   One of the central aims for our multidisciplinary mixed-method research design is thus a thorough reflection of the premises underlying our own research practice as different types of actors in the field of textual humanities. Scrutiny will be directed at built-in biases of training corpora used for machine-learning, but also at researchers' guiding schemata for scientific/scholarly action (Fleck's 'thought styles', see Andresen et al., 2018, and the epistemic cultures described by Knorr-Cetina, 1999): these are mutually determined by and determine reality and humanity, showing in research practice - as types of research questions, argumentation, interpretation, and methodology. Our methods for level 1 consist in a range of tools for reflective thinking, including meta-annotation of the (semi-)automatic and manual tags (for literary annotation, see Gius &amp; Jacke, 2017) and memos for documenting observations (Glaser, 2008). Level 1 will address the following questions:  Theoretical frameworks: What understanding of language and communication motivate the different approaches? What assumptions are made about the world, reality and humanity? Operationalization: What, if any, linguistic and literary categories and theories are being operationalized? What covert and overt decisions inform existing analytical practices? Results and interpretation: What rationale is used to discuss and interpret results? How do interpretations of results tie in with the respective theoretical frameworks? What open questions are foregrounded? What role and importance are given to the interpretation of data within the overall research projects? How is subjectivity discussed? Research practice: What explicit and implicit rationale motivates the employment of particular research processes?  Using the empirical research on web 2.0 discourses throughout its stages for our enquiry, we examine the underlying epistemologies that our team brings to the table, extrapolating from here to our field of textual DH generally. Our goal is not to find the best method, but to reveal underlying worldviews and epistemologies that guide the analysis - through principled reflective thinking: ""it enables us to know what we are about when we act.

Particularly vulnerable are older, female workers. In addition, the recruitment rate of over-55s in Switzerland is below the OEDC average. In order to address these problems, the OECD recommends a comprehensive strategy including notably measures in the fields of social security and employment law. In Switzerland, the difficult situation of older workers is commonly recognised, in particular with respect to finding employment. However, opinions differ as to the approach that should be taken to deal with the problem and, more specifically, as to whether the advice given by of the OECD should be followed. There is a marked political reluctance in Switzerland to follow the example of most other OECD countries, explicitly recommended by the OECD, of adopting specific legislation banning age discrimination in the field of private employment. With respect to social security, the OECD has commended Switzerland for its ""Altersvorsorge 2020"" plans. However, the Swiss voting population rejected the reform. Against this background, the present application concerns PhD research on the question of what legal measures Switzerland should usefully adopt in the field of employment law and in employment-related social security law in order to address the disadvantage suffered by older workers. An additional focus will be on disadvantage resulting from the combined effect of age and sex for older female workers. More specifically, the proposed study will look into the existing legal situation in Switzerland and engage in a comparative legal analysis of relevant approaches adopted by other European countries. With respect to anti-discrimination legislation in the field of private employment, the research will study the relevant law of the European Union (EU) and analyse critically whether or not Switzerland should choose the path of autonomous adaptation in this field, thereby following its previous approach in the field of sex discrimination. Due to a lack of relevant research, it is open at present whether this would be a useful approach also in the context of age. With respect to employment-related social security, the research will focus on Swiss law as compared to the law of selected other European states with respect to the coverage of occupational pension systems and age-related costs of contributions. In terms of the expected results, the research should contribute not only to the academic knowledge on the above-mentioned issues but also provide practically relevant information and recommendations as to useful measures to be taken by Switzerland.   [1] OECD (2014), Vieillissement et politiques de l'emploi: Suisse 2014.

Such MR images can be acquired reasonably fast, but their contrast is a non-trivial weighting of various intrinsic and extrinsic parameters and thus not a direct measure for a specific tissue property. As a result, pathological alterations are not identified from a measurable, objective change in tissue properties but rely on a subjective reading of contrast differences on a physically meaningless scale that is affected not only by various random factors but also by instrumentation. Quantification of the MR signal in terms of the underlying biochemical and biophysical tissue parameters is, therefore, generally thought to be the key to MR methodology to push conventional MRI beyond its current limits. It is thus not surprising that the prospect to perform MRI in the tradition of scientific instrumentation has attracted considerable interest in the MR scientific community ever since. Especially, the continuous improvement and progress in scanner hardware and reliability has not only facilitated quantification, but also stimulated the development of a wide variety of methods for the extraction different of biophysical and biochemical parameters. Noteworthy, although quantitative MRI dates back to the early 1970s, its research and development is not only ongoing but performed world-wide with increased interest and effort. Unfortunately, MR-based tissue quantification is typically a very time-consuming process and can be biased by numerous factors. It is thus not surprising that over the years and even for the most fundamental MR tissue parameters, such as tissue relaxation, a whole 'buffet' of MR methods has been proposed to tackle the 'reliable quantification in reasonable time' problem for a successful translation and application in the clinics. Only recently, the extraction of MR tissue quantities has become an even more important paramount goal since artificial intelligence and machine learning has entered the field of MRI relying on the availability of large amounts of standardized and comparable, such as quantitative, MRI data.

We await increasing season length to stimulate, but top-soil desiccation during summer drought to slow the carbon and nutrient cycle. We also expect that seasonal fine root dynamics are not in phase with leaf phenology, but continue throughout the snow-free period, despite and beyond pulsed leaf expansion.

Successful gene delivery requires the recognition of target cells as well as cytosolic and nucleosolic uptake of the gene. Currently,  non-viral based gene delivery such as transfection reagents are only suitable for in vitro applications and clinical gene therapeutics delivery is accomplished via viral vectors, which still has major safety concerns and complex and costly manufacturing procedures, preventing future implementation for the treatment of diseases with large patients groups. In the last 15 years, a class of secondary plant metabolites has been discovered that selectively mediates endosomal escape and cytoplasmic delivery of macromolecules only at low endosomal pH, thereby inducing a 40-fold enhanced gene delivery efficacy, in vivo. The currently employed methods of applying endosomal escape enhancers and gene therapeutic product, however, do not ensure that both compounds are at the same time at the site of interaction. The ENDOSCAPE technology platform will develop and collect proof of concept for a non-viral gene delivery technology with increased synchronization (in time and place) of both compounds. Proof of concept of the ENDOSCAPE technology has a major impact on the therapeutic opportunities for current and future macromolecule drugs for a broad range of diseases. All this induces new biotech-based businesses; new research projects and creates new technology platforms for development of new macromolecule therapeutics for a broad range of disease indications.

By the end of the project we realize a Quantum-limited Atomic Force Microscope (Q-AFM), where the force sensor is working at the fundamental limit of action and reaction set by quantum physics. Achieving this limit will result in three orders of magnitude improvement in force sensitivity and five orders of magnitude in measurement bandwidth, beyond the current state-of-the-art. This huge gain in performance will translate to a radical increase in imaging speed and in the information content of images. Our sensor will lead to a revolution in SPM, where multi-dimensional data sets are acquired in seconds, as opposed to several days as is the current practice. The key to reaching quantum-limited sensitivity lies in the the electro-mechanical coupling between the resonant mechanical force transducer and the readout circuit. While our ideas are based on well-established theories and some proof-of-concept measurements, but there is still a high risk that we can not reach the desired strong-coupling regime with an appropriate SPM sensor design. To mitigate this high risk we will pursue two different sensor designs, one based on electrostatic coupling and the other based on piezoelectric coupling.

As part of sustainability goals, both scientific and policy communities have so far strived (1) to develop energy-efficient building technologies (supply of technologies), and (2) to change the energy consumption behavior of residents and tenants (reduction of demand). But supply of technologies does not come to fruition, unless suppliers employ new technologies. And reduction of demand has limited impact, unless tenants can live in energy-efficient infrastructures. In fact, we currently lack a comprehensive understanding of what it takes to increase the supply of low-energy-consuming properties. Therefore, it is worth investigating the market- and property conditions under which investors are willing to pay for energy efficiency in buildings. Investments in energy efficiency are only interesting for investors if there is a financial incentive such as a rent premium. Existing rent premium analyses are concentrated in the commercial sector and the US market. Though some controlled for more detailed building characteristics than others, Miller et al. (2008), Eichholtz et al. (2010), and Fuerst et al. (2009) all found about 3 to 9% rent premium for certified green buildings. Reichhardt et al. (2012) added over-time trends of rent premiums. The only large-scale residential rent study in the US is Kahn and Kok (2013) with 1.6 million single-family house cases and estimates a 2.1% premium. In the Swiss context, Salvi et al. (2008, 2010) showing a 6% residential rent premium are the only studies coming close to our research interest. Yet, the studies are non-peer-reviewed private market analyses, and the sample size is limited to 150,000 and the ZH area. Beyond these data limitations, we identified two important issues to be tackled in rent premium analyses. First, Salvi et al. (2010) shows decreasing premiums of the traditional Minergie label over time. As building standards (both due to regulations and social norms) increase regardless of green certificates, the result may not be surprising. By controlling for buildings' actual energy performance and by exploiting newer data that include stricter Minergie subcategories, we shall re-assess the over-time trend of rent premiums. Second, the real estate literature has shown that rents are geographically autocorrelated (e.g. McCord et al. 2014). Therefore, we can deduce that, all else equal, the occurrence of a newly Minergie-certified building can have a positive spillover effect on the rents of proximate buildings that are not certified. The existence and degree of this (perhaps unwanted) spillover has never been estimated. With the new comprehensive dataset (ca. N=800,000) on asking rent prices and detailed building characteristics that we construct (see Section 7 &amp; 8 for more details), the following 3 related research questions can be answered in the Swiss residential market context. RQ1: What is the direction and extent of rent premiums associated with Minergie labels? Does the label generate its own premium, on top of the actual energy performance premium? RQ2: What is the intertemporal trend of Minergie-associated rent premiums? Given that buildings' energy performance generally improves over time, do a newer and stricter Minergie sublabels gain more premiums, compared to the older, original Minergie label? RQ3: Given that rents are spatially autocorrelated, does a new Minergie label obtained by a building generate positive spillover effects on rents of proximate buildings that are not certified?",energy efficiency; buildings; energy policy; rael estate; sustainable urban development,external_funding,Completed,4487773,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,389,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Three or more concurrent symptoms that may or may not share the same etiology can be characterized as a ""symptom cluster"". Underdiagnosed and undertreated symptoms and symptom clusters are associated with poor quality of life and decreased functional status in cancer patients. While rigorous research exists on the prevalence, characteristics, and management of single symptoms (e.g., pain, depression, fatigue), research on symptom clusters is limited. With a focus on personalized care, it is crucial to understand the underlying mechanism of symptom clusters and generate omics data, which combined with behavioral and biological data may help clinicians predict, treat, and manage treatment-related symptoms. Numerous pharmacological agents are available to help manage treatment-related symptoms in cancer patients, but polypharmacy may lead to medication interactions and unwanted side-effects. Thus, the American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends applying acupuncture as an evidence-based non-pharmacological intervention for treatment-related pain. The study examines the efficacy of acupuncture on symptom burden and common symptoms clusters experienced by breast cancer patients. The goal of this study is to investigate symptom clusters in breast cancer survivors, a possible genetic contribution to symptom clusters, and the efficacy of acupuncture to alleviate these symptoms. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) Identify long-term treatment-related symptom burden and symptom clusters among breast cancer survivors up to 12 months post-surgery; 2) Explore whether genetic variations contributing to symptom burden and symptom clusters; 3) Evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture to reduce symptom burden and improve quality of life. For Aims 1 and 2, we will use data collected for a descriptive, prospective, longitudinal study designed to assess the prevalence, severity and timing of occurrence of treatment-related symptoms, and candidate genes that may contribute to the occurrence and severity of these symptoms  in n=590 breast cancer patients after systemic treatment. For Aim 3, we will examine symptoms evaluated in a prospective, single blind, randomized multi-group comparison trial, which tested the efficacy of acupuncture to alleviate treatment-related symptoms in n=90 breast cancer patients receiving radiotherapy. Patients were randomized to n=30 Group 1 (received 18 acupuncture treatments according to traditional Chinese medicine guidelines); n=30 Group 2 (received 18 placebo vegetative-stimulating acupuncture treatments); and n=30 wait-listed control. Power analysis was conducted for both studies at the designing phase, for 80% power to detect a medium-small difference between means (d=0.3) or percentages (h=0.3) with a two-tailed z test and alpha=0.05.  For Aim 1, cluster analysis will determine the number and types of symptom clusters. Latent profile analyses will identify subgroups based on prespecified symptom clusters. For Aim 2, ANOVA will compare allele and genotype frequencies for cases (with a specific symptom cluster) and controls (without the symptom cluster). For Aim 3, I will look for intervention effects on symptom clusters within each group (baseline vs. follow up) and between groups (Group 1 vs. 2 vs. 3) with t test, Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test (follow-up minus baseline) and Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test within groups, based on distribution of outcomes. Breast cancer is a very common diagnosis for women worldwide. Due to advances in treatment the number of cancer survivors is expected to reach 18 millions in the US alone by 2022, with breast cancer survivors constituting 25% of them. Given the increasing number of breast cancer survivors, addressing long-lasting treatment-related symptoms is a public health priority, in order to alleviate burden on the healthcare system due to management of lingering symptoms, reduce costs due to polypharmacy, and facilitate these women entering back into the workforce. Thus, the proposed PhD study is significant for public health  because it will bring attention to the long-term management of breast cancer patients in the survivorship (beyond treatment) phase. Moreover, this study makes excellent use of existing resources, and will build a strong foundation in understanding studies with observational design versus studies with an experimental design. The long-term goal is to help breast cancer survivors assume their family, professional, and societal roles.

Distant Reading Topographies of Sentiment in German Swiss Novels in the early 20th Century,2019,"The project High Mountains Low Arousal? is a contribution to literary studies in terms of digital resource building, literary theory, and methodological development. By means of a distant reading of German-Swiss novels, it aims at pioneering comparative historiographical and systematic research on the German novel of the early 20th Century, using digital methodologies of advanced sentiment analysis (SA). Following the recent examples of theoretically sophisticated distant reading, the  project's focus is on the emotional encoding of fictional space and literary characters.  Sentiment analysis is one of the key methodologies of distant reading, yet its valid domain adaptation to German literary discourse is still pending. As SA is language-specific and highly sensitive to historical and discursive variation, its advanced domain adaptation for literary analysis is costly, but offers a strong gain in lending an unprecedented systematicity to exploration, hypothesis testing and prediction of literary forms and patterns. My approach applies a psychologically validated conceptualization of emotion, combining a dimensional approach to sentiment valence (positive, neutral, or negative sentiment) and arousal (strength of sentiment and emotion), with one to discrete emotions (such as fear, anger, joy).   The project aims at contributing a new data-driven and philologically reflected perspective on the historiography of Swiss novels of the early 20th Century, situated within the transnational continuum of the German-speaking countries. It  critically examines questions of the specificity of Swiss novels as compared to German and Austrian ones, addressing a putative Swiss marginalization, mediocracy, and predominance of anti-modernist realism surfacing in idyllic landscapes and simple plots. Through thus, it will shed a new view on ideas of Swissness transported by novels during the period, in between educative mediation (Helvetia mediatrix, Lecoultre) and the enactment of a national myth unfolding in spatial topographies that center around the Alps. Offering the first distant reading of the Swiss novel applying SA, the project is comparative within Swiss literature as well as at a transnational level. The overarching aim is to offer a data-driven exploration of the patterns of specificity of Swiss literature in close collaboration with the CA ""Distant Reading the European Novel"" - to advance digital resource building, literary theory, and methodological development.

"Christofori, Gerhard M.",NA,Departement Biomedizin / Tumor Biology (Christofori),Unraveling the common mechanisms between EMT and therapy resistance,2019,"Most cancer deaths are due to the systemic dissemination of cancer cells and the formation of secondary tumors (metastasis) in distant organs. Apparently, the migratory and invasive capabilities of cancer cells are critical parameters in the metastatic cascade. To leave the primary tumor and to invade into the surrounding tissue, tumor cells dissolve their cell-cell contacts and adjust their cell-matrix adhesion sites to a more transient, migratory and invasive mode. Such temporary and reversible phenomenon is known as an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a multistage process that involves distinct genetic and epigenetic alterations. A plethora of signaling pathways leading to the activation and expression of a variety of transcription factors, miRNAs, and lncRNAs are known to regulate the dramatic transcriptional reprogramming of cells undergoing an EMT. Some of the transcription factors act as master switches during embryonic organogenesis, tissue homeostasis or in a variety of pathological processes. Recent work has clearly demonstrated that an EMT induces a stem cell-like behavior of cancer cells, also furnishing them with an intriguing resistance to a variety of cancer therapies, including chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy, and to reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the actual contribution of an EMT to the metastatic process is still highly debated, yet currently referred to an increased cancer cell plasticity occurring during a transient EMT/MET. Hence, we need to better understand the molecular networks underlying the cell plasticity conferred by an EMT or MET and its functional contribution to malignant tumor progression and therapy resistance.As a main scientific aim of our project, we propose to dissect at a comprehensive level the molecular and cellular pathways which are induced by an EMT and underlie the development of cancer cell resistance to pharmacological therapies and to ROS. Importantly, it is currently not known whether an overall EMT process governs all these cellular capabilities or whether distinct subprograms administer an EMT, metastasis formation, stem cell-like behavior and therapy resistance. Moreover, our own preliminary data suggest that these pathways may differ between cancer cells cultured on plastic as compared to three-dimensional organoids or tumors growing in vivo. Here, we will employ novel mouse models of metastatic breast cancer in which cancer cells undergoing an EMT can be traced by genetic fate mapping. These mice and cell lines derived from their tumors, as well as tumor organoids generated from these cell lines, will be treated with various chemotherapies to induce an EMT and/or therapy resistance. The molecular pathways and gene activities during an EMT and during the development of therapy resistance will be identified by RNA sequencing and integrated bioinformatics analysis. The functional role of newly identified potential master regulators of EMT and therapy resistance will be validated in proof-of-concept experiments in cultured breast cancer cells in vitro and then in mouse models in vivo. Finally, from the resulting analytical bioinformatics data we will generate gene expression signatures of therapy resistance and test their diagnostic and prognostic value for clinical outcome in cancer patients. From these experiments, we not only anticipate novel insights into the molecular regulation of malignant tumor progression and cancer metastasis, but also envision to contribute to the design of new strategies towards innovative cancer diagnosis and prognosis and towards overcoming therapy resistance.",NA,external_funding,Active,4485989,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,398,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"Taylor, Verdon",NA,Departement Biomedizin / Embryology and Stem Cell Biology (Taylor),Drosha and its RNA binding partners in neurogenesis,2019,"Neural stem cells (NSCs) generate the central nervous system (CNS) and new neurons and glia in distinct brain regions of adult mammals. Regulation of NSC maintenance and differentiation is crucial but how they are controlled remain unclear. NSCs self-renew to maintain the progenitor pool, but also generate committed offspring in a regulated fashion. The balance between proliferation and differentiation guarantees brain formation, life-long neurogenesis, and prevents tumor formation. A detailed understanding of NSC biology has important implications for comprehending brain malformations, age-related disorders, and neurological diseases. The potential of NSCs for regeneration and rejuvenation of the brain emphasize the need to expand our basic knowledge of their biology. Over the last three decades, we have learnt a lot about the signaling pathways that can regulate NSC activity. Some of the signaling pathways and transcriptional networks controlling NSC fate are intimately linked, for example the Notch pathway and proneural transcription factors. However, it is becoming clear that post-transcriptional regulation of protein expression regulates NSC fate. My lab has focused on the role of signaling in NSC maintenance. By combining transgenic mice with analysis of NSC behavior during homeostasis, physical activity, degeneration, regeneration and aging in vivo and in vitro, we determined that NSCs are heterogeneous even within the same niche. Recently, we found that the adult ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) and subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) contain quiescent, active and dormant NSCs and loss of active NSCs is a primary cause for age-related reductions in neurogenesis. We found that the RNAseIII Drosha, a component of the microRNA (miRNA) microprocessor (MP), synergizes with Notch and plays fundamental roles in NSC maintenance and differentiation through a novel miRNA-independent mechanism. Drosha directly targets stem-loop hairpin structures in the mRNA of the proneural transcription factor Neurog2 during embryonic development and NFIB in adult NSCs and regulates fate and differentiation. Thus, post-transcriptional regulation is a novel and critical process in NSC differentiation. As all cells ubiquitously express Drosha, we questioned how Drosha activity is controlled in order that its mRNA targets can evade processing once the protein is required. By cross-linked RNA immunoprecipitation (CLIP) of endogenous Drosha, we have identified additional mRNA targets in NSCs. Using RNA pull-down assays and double mass-spectroscopy (MS/MS), we identified the proteins associated with Drosha-targeted mRNAs in NSCs. We hypothesize that these proteins, together with Drosha, regulate RNA stability and translation, and are crucial for brain development and homeostatic neurogenesis. We have developed screening systems to quantify Drosha processing of target mRNAs and to assess the functions of the RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and Drosha partners in NSCs. RBPs are a major family in of proteins and are encode by at least 7.5% of the genes in the genome. Many have links to human neurological disease, including some that bind Drosha and its targets. However, the functions of many of these RBPs in controlling brain development and neurogenesis are not known. RNA-Seq analysis revealed differential expression of many RBPs during development and adult neurogenesis. Here we will address the functions of Drosha associated proteins and RBPs that interact with its target mRNAs in NSCs of the embryonic and adult CNS.

"Hoch, Günter",NA,Departement Umweltwissenschaften / Physiological Plant Ecology (Kahmen),Explore the 'upper hidden half' of trees: The influence of crown position on the seasonal dynamics of biological processes in the canopy of a temperate mixed forest,2019,"Most biological processes in trees are driven by the environmental conditions within the canopy. While the canopy surface is climatically closely connected to the free atmosphere, the vertical structure of tree crowns causes steep gradients in all environmental factors (e.g., light, temperature, wind, humidity) from the upper to the lowest canopy layer. Forest canopies thus provide vertically stratified micro-climates that exert very different impacts on all physiological processes at different canopy layers. Although this effect is well recognized, the difficult access to mature tree crowns generally prevents extensive, direct investigations. Consequently, biological processes in forest canopies, like evapotranspiration and productivity, are normally assessed as integrated values across the entire canopy, either for the whole tree via stem measurements, or for an entire forest area via flux towers. The new canopy crane at a species-rich temperate mixed forest in Hölstein, provides the ideal infrastructure to perform in situ measurements within the entire crown volume of a total of ca. 260 mature trees of ten different species. For the current project, it is proposed to conduct the first spatially and temporally highly-resolved investigations on growth, leaf gas exchange, carbon reserve dynamics and water relations along the environmental gradient in canopies of broad-leaved and conifer tree species. Throughout three consecutive years, the following biological processes and traits will be recorded on permanently marked branches at four different canopy layers: leaf phenology, shoot growth and secondary branch growth, net leaf CO2-exchange, non-structural carbohydrate tissue concentrations, stomatal conductance and branch water potentials. The micro-climatic variability (radiation, temperature and humidity) within the canopy will be recorded at multiple sites along vertical crown profiles in different species, which will enable to correlate the observed processes and traits in branches to the local environmental conditions. By further accounting for the spatial tree distribution at the site, all processes dynamics measured for individual trees, can be extrapolated to the three-dimensional forest canopy. In addition, dendrometer measurements at the main stems will allow to compare measurements of processes at different canopy layers with the integrative signals recorded at the stem-level (e.g., stem radius increment vs. phenology and branch growth, tree water deficit vs. branch water potentials). By simultaneously investigating growth, carbon- and water-relations directly within the canopy of different tree species, this project will reveal closer insights in the functional interrelations of these processes that are key to understanding tree responses to environmental stresses, like drought. The explicit consideration of differences along the environmental gradient in the canopies will deliver three-dimensional information of the observed processes, which will be also necessary for the development of more realistic dynamic tree growth models.",NA,external_funding,Active,4485988,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,400,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Officially multilingual cities, such as Fribourg (Switzerland) and Brussels (Belgium), have received extended attention with regard to how language policies are locally implemented. Little is known, however, about how people choose and negotiate the language of conversation when addressing an unknown person - who might speak the local language, but also a language of immigration or tourism. Based on video-recordings collected in bilingual cities (Fribourg, Brussels), in touristic locations (Lugano, Ghent) and in areas of multiple contacts (Basel, Eupen), this project documents everyday language practices in public space. It focuses on encounters between unknown persons within two types of events: (1) Symmetrical Ordinary Encounters, which happen when people going about the same activity (e.g. sitting on a bench, walking the dog) start talking to each other; (2) Asymmetrical Institutional Encounters, during which someone requests something (e.g. a signature, political support, money) from a passer-by or offers something (e.g. a flyer, a product sample). It shows how, during the opening phase of an encounter, individuals progressively discover the linguistic options they have for efficiently engaging in interaction (ranging from the choice of one common language, to a mode of interaction in which speakers alternate languages, to conversations in which each individual speaks a different language, etc.). The diversity of resources speakers deploy in order to establish focused interaction with each other is analysed from a multimodal perspective, taking into account how linguistic resources are embedded in the individuals' embodied actions. Using multimodal conversation analysis and interactional linguistics, this project will provide the following results: (1) it will contribute to the analysis of conversational openings by systematically taking into account the individuals' embodied resources;(2) it will provide a situated analysis of language contact ""as it happens"" and show that the speakers' language choices are sensitive to the social categorisation of the interactants; (3) it will describe urban public space as a locus of multilingualism, hence challenging the present-day image of public space (often associated to fear and insecurity) in contemporary societies, by showing its relevance for pro-social ways of living; (4) it will also engender methodological guidelines for video recording in natural public settings of interaction",NA,external_funding,Active,4486261,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,402,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

In a study from a decade ago, it was estimated that almost 12 million people are infected with this parasite, over 350 million people are at risk, and approximately 7000 deaths are annually attributable to the Leishmania infection (Bern et al. 2008). In humans, the Leishmania donovani species causes the most severe, visceral form of leishmaniasis, in which the parasite reside within liver, spleen and bone marrow macrophages. Emaciation, anemia and increased susceptibility to a variety of infections can lead to very high mortality (Chatterjee 2009). Available treatments have high toxicity and have already elicited resistance in the parasites (Chappuis et al. 2007). Within human populations, clinical manifestations of the disease are highly heterogeneous, due to the parasite itself, as well as to the genetic background and environment of the individual (Saporito et al. 2013). The heterogeneous response of cells, organisms and individual immune systems to infectious agents is the basis for both the limited impact of epidemics as well as the limited efficacy of vaccines. For reasons that remain poorly understood, cells within an individual organism are not equally susceptible to infection. In this study we will focus on a model system that is well established in the Bhattacharyya lab, namely the infection of mammalian macrophages with the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani (Ld), aiming to uncover factors that contribute to the susceptibility of individual cells to infection. We will use macrophages from rodent species with distinct susceptibility to infection by this parasite and we will profile their gene expression both in the absence of any challenge as well as in time series after 'priming', through exposure to stimuli that are are known to affect the cytokine profile of macrophages (lipopolysaccharide (LPS), parasite-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) and supernatant from infected macrophages). By analyzing computationally the gene expression profiles, we will infer activities of regulatory factors - transcription factors and miRNAs - in macrophages from different genetic backgrounds, that were primed in various ways. In parallel, we will evaluate the susceptibility of these cell populations to infection by measuring the parasitic load after the exposure to the parasite. By relating the molecular profile prior to infection to the parasite load of the cells upon infection, we will uncover cell-autonomous factors that contribute to differential susceptibility and cellular pathways that are engaged by pathogen-derived components to modulate the susceptibility to infection. Furthermore, we will elucidate how the priming of macrophages and their initial polarization affects their susceptibility to the infection with this protozoan parasite. We will then validate these findings by directly manipulating these pathways to reduce the susceptibility of host cells to infection. Finally, our data will provide a first glimpse into the single cell level heterogeneity of macrophages from various sites and genetic backgrounds, which is relevant for the immune response to a wide range of pathogens.","macrophage, single cell, Leishmania donovani, gene expression",external_funding,Active,4491797,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,405,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"Aceto, Nicola",NA,Departement Biomedizin / Cancer Metastasis (Aceto),Exploiting Small Molecules to Unravel Vulnerabilities of Circulating Tumor Cells,2019,"Breast cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in women, accounting for 25.1% of all cancers and resulting in more than 500'000 deaths per year worldwide (http://www.who.int). The leading cause of death for breast cancer patients is not the primary tumor itself, but the development of metastasis. Metastasis-related mortality in breast cancer reflects our limited understanding of the complex processes that drive the spread of cancer and points to the inability of the currently used preclinical models to fully recapitulate the clinical setting. Currently, most of these preclinical models rely on cancer cell lines that have been adapted to long-term culture in two-dimensional plastic dishes, and do not share many of the properties of metastatic cancer cells, including their mutational profile.Using blood specimens from cancer patients, we have recently improved our understanding on the processes driving the establishment of metastasis. For example, we discovered that circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can enter the bloodstream as single cells or clusters of cells (CTC-clusters), with the latter being associated to higher propensity to seed metastasis. Further, we have shown that CTCs isolated from breast cancer patients can also be propagated in culture under specific conditions, retaining a clustered 3D structure. These CTC-derived cell lines represent a unique preclinical model for discovery of new therapies, particularly because they can be used as three-dimensional drug screening platforms, they share the mutational profile of metastatic cancers, are tumorigenic, and spontaneously metastasize in mice reflecting the metastatic pattern of the patient of origin.In parallel to the development of new preclinical models, small molecules have been instrumental in several breakthrough studies to investigate the biology of cancer and to identify biological targets along with existing genetic and molecular biology technologies. Small molecules as a chemical tool offer a unique opportunity to investigate cancer vulnerabilities and unknown complex biological mechanisms that define cancer biology, leading to the identification of new targets and potential therapeutic agents. Along these lines, there are extraordinary examples of how small molecules helped to understand various biological pathways in the recent past, including cytoskeleton biology through colchicine and paclitaxel, mTOR signaling through Rapamycin, MG132 in proteasome function, and recently CRBN-CUL4 E3 by thalidomide analogs and JQ1 for bromodomain biology and pharmacology. In this proposal, we aim to combine for the first time two very powerful tools, i.e., state-of-the-art human CTC-derived models that recapitulate metastatic cells and a large natural- and synthetic-origin compound library (~80.000 compounds) to identify novel inhibitors of metastasis. Specifically, this collaborative project will be divided into two main aims. First, we will screen libraries of small molecules capable of selectively inducing cell death in CTCs, or impede their self-renewal potential that is needed for metastasis formation. This approach will be complemented by RNA sequencing experiments to identify affected pathways, and synthetic lethal screens to identify relationships between mutations and drug sensitivity. Second, we will perform medicinal chemistry to improve structure-activity relationships on selected lead compounds, and test them in preclinical (mouse) cancer models.All together, our project brings together the unique tools provided by each of the project partners to unravel vulnerabilities of circulating tumor cells and to identify novel inhibitors of metastasis.

Group 3 (Caroline Arni): Genealogical Diagrams in an Urban Society, 19th and early 20th Cen. Group 3 applies the diagrammatic approach to relatedness by examining different kinds of genealogical reconstruction performed within the same social context. Recent research has argued that the shaping of modern concepts of collective entities such as families, national and communal communities, or species has been driven by global exchange and political ruptures: Experiences of diversity and discontinuity, it is argued, generated a need for conceiving continuity through change (f.e. Parnes et al. 2008; Müller-Wille &amp; Rheinberger 2012; Engelstein 2017). While this argument is solidly founded in a historical epistemology that pays attention to contexts of production, it also calls for a methodological expansion with regard to a social-historical approach. The city of Basel in the modern period provides a particularly pertinent case for answering that call. It confronts us with an urban society defined by the global activity of trading houses and industrial entrepreneurship, by a conflict-laden and protracted path to democratization, and by a high influx of migrant workers who came from neighboring cantons as well as from the German and French areas and who constituted a highly mobile and diverse population. Within this society, there existed a great concern for the conceptualization of relations in terms of descent that left its traces in a rich body of archival material. That Basel was also the place where in 1861, J. J. Bachofen made the claim that the very patrilineal order represented in the family trees of his contemporaries was a central pillar of human progress, which he conceived of as a departure from the primordial matrilineal societies, and where in 1874, F. Nietzsche derided the longing for the undisturbed continuity of familial and urban community might just be the kind of arbitrary coincidence history yields. But it certainly adds to the allure of Basel as an exemplary site for exploring how practices of conceiving, determining, and representing relatedness in terms of descent were integral to a specific social and political situation, its history and development.The group examines two sites of such practices: the bourgeois family and the psychiatric institution. They provide material for a diagrammatic approach to how genealogy was practiced in a familial and a scientific context respectively (for the upsurge in genealogical research in diverse areas in this time period, see Gausemeier 2008; for the scientific and cultural use of genealogy in Switzerland, see Germann 2016, 183-221). The two projects' shared framework renders possible the comparison of how these parallel practices of genealogy dealt with and formed a specific historical situation.","genealogy, diagram, relatedness, kinship, family tree, psychiatry",external_funding,Active,4500387,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,407,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE
"Ammann, Sonja",NA,Fachbereich Theologie / Altes Testament (Ammann),Transforming Memories of Collective Violence in the Hebrew Bible,2019,"Violence in biblical texts is often disturbing to the modern reader. To counter this ethical indignation, current biblical scholarship has pointed out that biblical texts often emerged in reaction to experiences of collective violence and were written from the perspective of the vanquished. Moreover, narratives of past violence - such as narratives of the conquest of Canaan or the book of Esther - are recognized as ideological fiction rather than reliable historical accounts. A growing consensus in biblical scholarship holds that the biblical texts were written mainly after the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem. The fictional narratives of violence can thus be explained as ""counterpresent"" memory, stemming from a time when the producers of these texts were in no actual position of power. But as we can see in biblical texts like the books of Maccabees, the counter-historical construction of memory might also go the other way round, producing victimological rather than triumphalist narratives. Comparative evidence from ancient Near Eastern and Greek historical narratives confirms the existence of such patterns. In this project, we will argue that biblical memories of vanquishing and being vanquished are intertwined and need to be studied together as interrelated aspects of the cultural memory of collective violence. In recent years, biblical scholars have increasingly used literary and cultural trauma theories to describe the relationship between experiences of collective violence and their reflection in biblical texts. Building on insights from recent trauma research within and beyond biblical studies, we will explore the cultural function of biblical narratives of collective violence as part of Israel's cultural memory in post-monarchic times. We will draw on V. Volkan's concepts of ""chosen trauma"" and ""chosen glory"" as a tool for analysing texts produced by a group that has experienced collective violence and that, through imaginary literature, copes with the violent potential within the group.The four sub-projects focus each on one specific area of biblical narratives which led to the commemoration of a ""trauma"" or ""glory"" in the later history of reception: the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem (2 Kgs 24-25; 2 Chr 36; Jer 37-43; Jer 52; 1 Esdras 1); the conquest of the land of Canaan in the book of Joshua (Josh 6-11); the religious persecution and subsequent triumph of the Maccabees (1-2 Macc); and the collective violence at the end of the book of Esther (Esth 8-9). The research team will work together to develop an integrated view on how ancient Israel coped with collective violence - including its own violent potential - through the literary construction of an imagined history of violence.The project will test the following working hypotheses: 1) memories of vanquishing and of being vanquished are interrelated in biblical narratives of collective violence; 2) biblical narratives of collective violence evolve in relation to historical changes and, as part of shared cultural memory, contribute to identity formation or the legitimation of power in different historical contexts; 3) biblical narratives of collective violence are a means of coping both with violence experienced and with the group's own violent potential.We anticipate that the results of this project will a) provide new and historically-grounded interpretations of difficult biblical texts, b) provide insights into strategies of coping with experiences of collective violence and with a group's own violent potential, and c) reassess and contribute to contemporary trauma studies.","Hebrew Bible, Trauma Studies, Violence, Collective Memory, Historical Criticism, Esther, Joshua, Maccabees",external_funding,Active,4487783,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,408,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

This approach succeeded in a massive increase of people receiving ART in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, despite substantial progress, HIV/AIDS remains a leading cause of morbidity and death in Sub-Saharan Africa. Further progress towards ending the AIDS epidemic is challenged by several factors: (i) scaling up ART provision among ""hard-to-reach"" populations, (ii) maintaining the rising numbers of patients on ART in under-resourced health care facilities while international funding support decreases, (iii) preventing and adapting to emerging resistance of HIV to current drugs, (iv) improving outcomes among children and adolescents taking ART. To meet the above-listed challenges, continuing the ""one size fits all"" approach will not be sufficient, and refining the public health approach through differentiated care models (DCM) will be required. ""Differentiated care"" is the term describing the adjustment of treatment programs to a patient's individual needs and prognosis. DCMs have the potential to improve patient outcomes as well as cost-effectiveness through better allocation of resources. However, to date the data on DCMs at larger scale are scarce and generating evidence through randomized trials in differentiated care represents an urgent requirement. Aim of the Project:This project entails four randomized trials (RCT) aiming to test innovative new DCMs in real-life settings and assess relevant endpoints of clinical response/outcome, virological control as well as the cost-effectiveness of interventions. The DCMs tested all make use of new and innovative technologies and - if successful - have the potential to be integrated into future guidelines and policies. All RCTs will be conducted in Lesotho, Southern Africa. RCT-3 will additionally include research sites in South Africa and RCT-4 will include sites in Tanzania.Planned Studies:RCT-1: HOSENG trial: ""Home-based testing plus self-testing to improve HIV diagnosis coverage in rural Lesotho"" - an open-label cluster randomized trial. Including 100 clusters with &gt;10'000 individuals, this trial assesses if combining home-based HIV testing with dispensing of oral self-test kits to household members absent during home-based HIV testing is an effective approach to reach high testing coverage in remote rural hard-to-reach settings.RCT-2: VIBRA trial: ""Village-based refill of ART after same-day ART start vs a clinic-based ART provision to HIV-positive individuals not on ART after home-based HIV testing"" - an open-label cluster randomized trial in rural Lesotho. This trial aims at improving linkage to care, initiation of and retention on ART to achieve viral suppression in individuals newly diagnosed with HIV during home-based testing in remote rural settings. It is the first trial to test a DCM using village-health-worker based ART-care right from diagnosis.RCT-3: VITA-LENA trial: ""Viral load triggered ART care in Lesotho and KwaZulu Natal"" - an open-label cluster-randomized trial. The proposed DCM called ""VITA"" uses an innovative database that groups patients on ART automatically into different follow-up algorithms depending on their last viral load result, and informs patients automatically about their viral load results via SMS. Grading intensity of follow-up according to viral load result shall allow to optimize resource-allocation in HIV care and improve patient-outcomes. Sending results via SMS directly to patients shall promote treatment literacy.RCT-4: GIVES-MOVE trial: ""Genotype-Informed Versus Empiric Management Of VirEmia"" in children and adolescents: an open-label randomized trial. This will be the first trial to test if management informed by genotypic resistance testing improves outcomes of children and adolescents with treatment failure while taking ART, and if this will be cost-effective. It will be conducted simultaneously in Lesotho and Tanzania.POLE-project: In addition to the four RCTs, the ""Point Of care Lamivudine Emtricitabine"" (POLE) project aims at developing the first point-of-care test for measurement of lamivudine and emtricitabine concentration and to integrate this test into DCM.The studies listed above will be conducted in close collaboration with:-SolidarMed, Swiss Organization for Health in Africa (www.solidarmed.ch)-Ministry of Health of Lesotho-Molecular Virology of the Department of Biomedicine, Haus Petersplatz, University of Basel-Human Sciences Research Council of South Africa (RCT-3)-Department of Global Health, University of Washington, United States-Ifakara Health Institute, Tanzania (RCT-4)-Department of Infectious Diseases, University Hospital of Geneva, Switzerland-Laboratory Services, University Hospital of Lausanne, Switzerland",Antiretroviral Therapy; Sub-Saharan Africa; HIV/AIDS; HIV/AIDS guidelines and policies; Differentiated Care; Service Delivery,external_funding,Active,4487835,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,409,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Within the project, we adopt a transdisciplinary approach in order to cross the boundaries between archaeological and philological scholarship and better understand the so-called 'heterogeneous' papyri which bear several texts and drawings belonging to various genres, e.g., maps, plans, accounts, poems, hymns and letters and have never been studied as a coherent whole. They are, however, of primary importance for the study of the wide competence and the performance of ancient scribes at work, both synchronically and diachronically. The papyri stem from the village of Deir el-Medina, a literate community which housed the families of the workmen who built the royal tombs in the Valley of the Kings and the surrounding necropolis during the New Kingdom (c. 1350-1000 BCE). The project partners are the University of Basel (Switzerland), the Université de Liège (Belgium) and the Museo Egizio (Turin, Italy), where the most important collection of papyri from this site is kept. The project aims to identify the fragments of heterogeneous papyri from this collection, to piece the fragments together and provide a digital reconstruction of the original documents, to study the variety of texts attested on each papyrus, to assess the numbers of scribal hands and reconstruct the history of these documents, to enrich the results with data coming from other ancient Egyptian archives of heterogeneous papyri, and to broaden the perspective by comparing the data from Deir el-Medina with complex scribal practices from other periods and places. We expect our project to exert a major impact on three main levels: from a cultural heritage point of view, it will lead to the reconstruction of number of ancient Egyptian papyri, now in fragmentary state; (2) from a Digital Humanities point of view, new learning algorithms and a dedicated interface will be developed to piece together hundreds of fragments of papyri; (3) from a cultural history point of view, we aim at significant new insights about Egyptian scribal culture, demonstrating that many textual categories (administrative, legal, historical, religious, or literary) could appear on a single document and mastered by individual scribes.","Papyrology, Egyptology, scribal practices, digital humanities",external_funding,Active,4486438,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,410,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

The theoretical basis of my work is offered by the application of the socio-cultural model of ""empire""-understood as a hierarchical configuration of power-to the context of the emergence and development of documentary Arabic. My main interest lies in the social behaviour of the imperial Arab-Muslim elite vis-à-vis the culturally and ethnically diverse populations of the Early Islamic imperial polity through the lens of virtually the whole spectrum of published Arabic papyrological, epigraphic as well as numismatic sources. These include ca. 760 documents on papyrus and parchment, ca. 870 inscriptions and graffiti and ca. 550 coin types and sub-types in addition to several hundreds of seals, vessel stamps, and inscribed objects spreading from Andalusia to Afghanistan. In view of the typologically and geographically uneven repartition of the evidence, documentary features that are more heavily influenced by pondered social factors-particularly mise en page, formulae, and technical terminology-provide the common analytical framework for sources produced in widely different geo-cultural realities. Thematically, I approach the question of the social and cultural trends that shaped Early Islamic Arabic writing from the perspective of a cluster of intertwined linguistic and social dynamics underscored by: 1) The functional interplay of Arabic and other languages used in the Early Islamic chanceries including Greek, Coptic, Sogdian, Middle Persian, Latin and Middle Aramaic, 2) the development of Arabic from a minority language into a lingua franca for medium and long term exchange across the Mediterranean basin and beyond, 3) the ""mediality"" of practices of public Arabic writing-meaning those features that operated beyond and independently of a semantic comprehension 4) the formulaic and graphic distinctiveness of Early Islamic Arabic documentary standards compared to previous and neighboring scribal traditions, and 5) the regional influences that shaped local styles of imperial representation.","Early Islamic Empire, Arabic Papyrology, Formal Varieties of Arabic Documents, Multilingualism and Multiglossia in the Early Islamic Empire, Early Islamic Society",external_funding,Completed,4488771,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,411,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

State-space search is challenging due to the state explosion problem a.k.a. curse of dimensionality: interesting state spaces are often astronomically large, defying brute-force exploration. State-space search has been a core research problem in Artificial Intelligence since its early days and is alive as ever. Every year, a substantial fraction of research published at the ICAPS and SoCS conferences is concerned with state-space search, and the topic is very active at general AI conferences such as IJCAI and AAAI. Algorithms in the A* family, dating back to 1968, are still the go-to approach for state-space search. A* is a graph search algorithm whose only ""intelligence"" stems from a so-called heuristic function, which estimates the distance from a state to the nearest goal state. The efficiency of A* depends on the accuracy of this estimate, and decades of research have pushed the envelope in devising increasingly accurate estimates. In this project, we question the ""A* + distance estimator"" paradigm and explore three new directions that go beyond the classical approach:  We propose a new paradigm of declarative heuristics, where heuristic information is not represented as distance estimates, but as properties of solutions amenable to introspection and general reasoning. We suggest moving the burden of creativity away from the human expert by casting heuristic design as a meta-optimization problem that can be solved automatically. We propose abandoning the idea of exploring sequential paths in state spaces, instead transforming state-space search into combinatorial optimization problems with no explicit sequencing aspect.

In Ghana and Tanzania the major challenges are to understand how to increase and sustain coverage, expand the benefits package for people in the informal sector, and ensure effective coverage with services and financial risk protection to the poorest segments of the population. In addition to the need for more funding, it is important for both countries to develop effective approaches to define eligibility criteria and better identify and target the excluded poor, and to ensure that the rights of citizens who are less likely to be covered are properly addressed. This requires health system governance conducive and responsive to all population groups. Governance in health systems design is rarely studied and little is known about how civil society can improve governance and coverage of social health protection. The project intends to address two related challenges: how can the excluded population be better identified and reached to include them in financing protection mechanisms; how can accountability mechanisms and civil society improve health system governance to support the implementation of inclusive and sustainable social health protection systems. The project will use mixed methods approaches combining collection and analysis of both quantitative, experimental, and qualitative data as well as participatory approaches. It will be composed of two main parts. Part 1 will address the questions of who is excluded from social health protection, why, and the cost and health system implications of including them. It will first investigate the characteristics of the population that is not benefiting from social health protection in Ghana and Tanzania, and the main determinants of exclusion. Secondly, it will assess the health benefits of inclusion in social health protection and which health system factors are crucial. Thirdly, it will identify and validate predictors of inclusion/exclusion that could be used to monitor the performance of social health protection systems. Fourthly, it will investigate in depth the reasons why certain population groups are excluded from social health protection and what could be done to include and engage them. Lastly, it will develop a model to predict the impact of extending social health protection under different scenarios for the health systems in terms of both financial resources and service delivery changes required. Part 2 will focus on evaluating approaches to improve targeting of the poor and governance (with a focus on voice, transparency and accountability) for promoting a more inclusive social health protection. It will first identify the recent experiences and approaches to extend social health protection in Ghana and Tanzania, analyzing them using a health system governance framework. This analysis is expected to reveal opportunities or problems with regard to governance, in particular involving the civil society, in enhancing design and implementation of social health protection.

Lately, however, the use of natural products as starting points for the development of new drugs has been declining, mainly due to the lack of developability of natural molecules as compared to synthetic ones. The fact that natural compounds cannot easily be modified also hinders target identification, and for many antiparasitic phytochemicals the mode of action is unknown. We aim to overcome this roadblocks by combining phytochemistry and synthetic chemistry, supported by molecular modeling and cell biology. The primary focus is on the waltheriones from Waltheria indica, which are quinoline alkaloids we have previously isolated and shown to be highly active against Trypanosoma cruzi.

The ambition of the project is to pursue this perspective, but examine its potential for markedly philosophical readings of New Confucianism.

We focus on the classical setting, one of the traditional core areas of artificial intelligence (AI). After decades of intensive research, planning algorithms have recently reached a level of maturity that makes them useful for real-world decision-making scenarios. With this increased maturity of planning algorithms, raw performance is no longer automatically the main concern for AI researchers or AI engineers interested in using planning algorithms in the systems they build. Besides efficiency, increasing demands are placed on the reliability of planning algorithms. We identify two ways in which current planning algorithms are brittle, and we suggest ways to improve their reliability. Specifically, we consider the following two challenges: 1. Certified Correctness: As planning is a model-based approach, there are clear notions of correctness: a sound and complete planning algorithm must return a solution if one exists and report unsolvability when no solution exists. An optimal planning algorithm must additionally guarantee that all solutions it returns are of optimal quality. This means that planning algorithms can be incorrect in three ways. They can return solutions that do not actually solve the given problem, falsely claim that a problem is unsolvable, or falsely claim that a solution is optimal (or bounded suboptimal). While the first kind of error can be detected with plan validators, the other two are much more challenging. In critical applications, possible algorithmic errors, implementation bugs, or even malicious programming (for example due to manipulated programs or ulterior motives of the algorithm implementers) are serious concerns. We investigate planning algorithms that always justify their answers in a way that can be verified independently, automatically, and efficiently. 2. Guaranteed Performance: In many scenarios where a planning algorithm could be used, guaranteeing its correctness is not sufficient. It is also necessary to ensure that in all relevant situations, the algorithm reliably produces a plan within the available computational resources. This is especially true in (common) settings where many similar problems must be solved repeatedly. Current algorithms do not provide performance guarantees, and small differences in the input can make the difference between solutions found within milliseconds, days, or not at all. Due to the PSPACE-completeness of classical planning, there will always be cases where quick solutions are not feasible. However, in many scenarios efficient planning is possible.

They are characterized by somatic mutations inducing hyperactive JAK2 signaling, which activates STAT-, phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. Activation of the MAPK pathway in MPN is not well characterized. Particularly the significance of ERK1 and ERK2 (ERK1/2) has not been clarified. Investigations of the MAPK pathway and specifically ERK1/2 are promising to develop improved therapeutic approaches. JAK2 inhibitors have been developed due to the central role of JAK2 for oncogenic signaling in MPN, but fail to induce molecular remission and elicit resistance. Moreover, the MAPK pathway remains activated in MPN in vivo despite JAK2 inhibition, suggesting that the JAK2-independent signaling via the MAPK pathway limits the efficacy of JAK2 inhibitor therapy. We have shown that dual inhibition of JAK2 and MEK1/2, intermediate kinases in the MAPK pathway, is superior to JAK2 inhibitor monotherapy in preclinical MPN models. This highlights the relevance of the MAPK pathway and calls for further studies on MAPK signaling in MPN addressing also the role of ERK1/2, downstream kinases involved in hematopoiesis. My application for the Research Fund of University of Basel outlines these further studies on significance and therapeutic potential of targeting ERK1/2 in MPN. We will investigate the role of ERK1/2 for MPN pathogenesis and evaluate dual targeting of JAK2 and ERK1/2, as ERK could be a favourable therapeutic target.

However, these bottom-up approaches are still far from understanding how morphogen acts. Therefore, in this proposal, I would like to take an alternative top-down approach to directly and acutely manipulate the endogenous Dpp morphogen gradient at the protein level. Keys to achieving this goal are protein binders such as nanobodies or DARPins (Designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins) with strong binding affinity against their targets like antibodies. Unlike conventional antibodies, protein binders function as single domain proteins. Therefore, protein binders can be expressed and functionalized in the cells by fusing them with a functional domain of other proteins. Recently, I generated (1) a robust genome engineering platform to insert a tag or introduce mutations in the endogenous dpp gene, and (2) novel synthetic trap system consisting of protein binders (scFv, nanobodies, DARPins) fused to the transmembrane domain of CD8 to trap Dpp on the cell surface. By combining these novel tools, it is now possible to visualize and directly manipulate endogenous Dpp morphogen gradient at the protein level.Using these novel tools, I will ask the following specific questions:(1) What is the spatial and temporal requirement of Dpp dispersal for patterning and growth of wing disc?(2) What is the mechanism of Dpp gradient formation (exocytosis, dispersal, and endocytosis)(3) What is the mechanism of scaling of the Dpp morphogen gradient with tissue size?Direct manipulation of morphogen gradient using the synthetic receptors would allow me to distinguish between a variety of models proposed for how Dpp acts as a morphogen to control organ development. Furthermore, I am open to see unexpected results that require changing our current understanding of morphogen function. Since a variety of evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways have been repeatedly used as morphogens during development, my approach would give technological and biological impact to study cell-cell communications in general. Given recent attempts reconstructing functional human organs in vitro, our approaches should also be applicable to investigate how human organs develop and how defects in cell-cell communications lead to malformations and diseases.",Morphogen; Dpp/BMP; patterning; growth; scFv; DARPins; Drosophila; nanobody,external_funding,Active,4483728,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,423,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"Brendl, C. Miguel",NA,Departement Wirtschaftswissenschaften / Marketing (Brendl),"Predicted pleasure, motivation, and psychological utility",2019,"According to economics people base their decisions on how valuable they expect the result of the decision to be. Economics assumes that a decision maker can map the value of every outcome of a decision onto a single scale, called utility. This way they can choose between outcomes that are very different. They can trade off the pleasure of eating a desert now with the expected pain of a heart attack later by comparing the expected utilities from eating and suffering from a heart attack. Psychologist focus on how we best describe utility itself, how the mind represents it, and which factors it is influenced by. Historically it has been hypothesized that the mind represents utility in terms of the pleasure and pain of decision outcomes. It has also been hypothesized that pleasure and pain are the ultimate causes of motivation. It would thus follow that the utility a decision maker predicts for an outcome corresponds to the pleasure s/he expects for that outcome, and this in turn drives the degree to which s/he is motivated to pursue the outcome. In this project we seek to provide evidence that motivation to pursue an outcome can be high while predicted pleasure can be relatively low, or more generally, that motivation and predicted pleasure may diverge. This raises the question whether predicted pleasure or motivation underlies utility. We attempt to show that overt behavior that seeks to bring about an outcome can be influenced either by predicted pleasure or by motivation, even if they diverge. This would suggest that the utility of the outcome could be based on either predicted pleasure or motivation, even if the two are not the same.",liking; wanting; preference; hedonic consumption; psychological utility; motivation; pleasure; predicted pleasure; predicted utility; decision utility,external_funding,Active,4486009,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,424,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"Martin, Ivan",NA,Departement Biomedizin / Tissue Engineering (Martin); Bereich Operative Fächer (Klinik) / Tissue Engineering (Martin),Direct 3D Bioprinting strategies to study articular cartilage development and regenerative therapy for osteoarthritis,2019,"By the year 2030, approximately 25% of the adult population is projected to suffer from clinically diagnosed osteoarthritis (OA). At present OA cannot be treated, but only the associated pain is managed by administration of anti-inflammatory drugs. Implantation of tissue engineered cartilage in the affected lesions has been a hotly pursued research area worldwide for last three decades. However, this line of research has not succeeded so far. The most common problem encountered is that the engineered cartilage generated using mesenchymal progenitor cells (MSCs) does not share the molecular properties of native permanent cartilage but, instead, become vascularized, undergoes hypertrophic differentiation and eventually is replaced by bone once implanted in vivo. These latter features characterize both the transient cartilage (i.e.; cartilage formed at the epiphyseal growth plates of long bones) and the articular cartilage in OA joint. The overall objective of this proposal is to engineer a cartilage tissue which will be molecularly indistinguishable from healthy articular cartilage and which remains phenotypically stable also when implanted in a OA environment. We propose a comprehensive plan to achieve this, at the core of which is to engineer developmental processes in order to control fate specification by MSC and developing functional cartilage tissue construct by 3D bioprinting.Working hypothesis. Most of the tissue engineering studies did not take into account: (i) the natural process of permanent cartilage differentiation; (ii) the molecular niche in native permanent cartilage and the changes it undergoes during OA; (iii) the nature of the engineered cartilage; (iii) the effect that the niche, particularly the altered one in OA, has on tissue engineered cartilage. In the current proposal, we will develop a comprehensive strategy for designing a disease modifying therapy of OA, combining our strengths in 3D bioprinting, biomedical engineering, microfluidics and joint cartilage developmental biology. We hypothesize that phenotypical stable cartilage can be engineered by culturing MSC with signalling proteins (i.e.: Wnt ligands) and morphogenetic inhibitors (BMP inhibitors) recently shown (mainly by the applicants) to be key in regulating differentiation of MSC into stable or transient cartilage. Specific aims &amp; experimental design. The first aim is to generate 3D bioprinted permanent cartilage in vitro. For this purpose, we will initially perform a screening of different doses and temporal stages of supplementation of Wnt ligands and BMP inhibitor within a microfluidic platform allowing generating and perfusing 3D MSCs microaggregates. This will allow identify the most promising conditions enabling the differentiation of MSCs into stable cartilage, to be scaled up and applied into the 3D bioprinted constructs. We will then explore use of silk-gelatin bioink tethered pathway-regulatory molecules on differentiation of the encapsulated mesenchymal cells (Aim 1). Once this is achieved, we will work towards two distinct but complementary approaches: (i) We will develop an in vitro model for OA. For this we will activate BMP signalling in the 3D bioprinted permanent cartilage to investigate if it recapitulates changes associated with OA. This will allow us to create a platform for rapid screening of drugs or other bioactive molecules which may be therapeutically relevant (Aim2). We will then develop bioink which will be either sensitive to matrix metalloproteases or mechanical stimulation to release in situ BMP inhibitors to protect the 3D bioprinted permanent cartilage once implanted in an OA joint (induced in mice), environment which would instead promote transient cartilage differentiation (Aim 3).Expected value of the proposed project. Even after 30 years of efforts, fabrication of load bearing and clinically relevant, biochemically equivalent cartilage tissue constructs still remains elusive. We are aware that this is a novel and highly ambitious objective, but collectively we have the necessary expertise and insight to attempt this, which if achieved will surely be a major boost for developing a disease modifying therapy for OA.",NA,external_funding,Active,4491794,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,425,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

"Rost, Michael",NA,Ethik / Bio- und Medizinethik (Elger),Maternal Autonomy in Obstetric Decision-Making,2019,"In Switzerland, annually more than 165.000 mothers and fathers experience the birth of their child. These parents hope for a normal and good birth. However, over the past years, an increasing number of women publicly opened up about negative birth experiences. They reported instances of humiliation, violence, coercion, or manipulation. In fact, research on women's experiences during childbirth indicates that maternal autonomy is insufficiently respected and, hence, that intrapartum decision-making (IP-DM) has to be improved in order to promote women's autonomy, to protect their bodily integrity, and to prevent them from impaired psychological health outcomes.In light of the widespread occurrence of autonomy-depriving IP-DM, there is an urgent need to study Swiss mothers' and Swiss obstetric staff members' attitudes and motives toward IP-DM. Further, it is recommended that women have access to various types of birth settings (e.g. home, freestanding midwifery unit, hospital). Thus, the aim of this study is to better understand women's and obstetric staff members' attitudes toward IP-DM and to analyze the spatial accessibility of different birth settings in Switzerland. To fulfill this goal, this study will not only conduct one-on-one interviews with Swiss women and obstetric staff members, but will also carry out a survey in order to gather additional quantitative data from Swiss women. Finally, spatial accessibility analysis will be employed. Accordingly, this project seeks to answer the following guiding research questions:(1) What are women's attitudes, motives, expectations, and experiences with respect to IP-DM and maternal autonomy?(2) What are obstetric staff members' attitudes, motives, and experiences with respect to IP-DM and maternal autonomy?(3) How much value do Swiss women place on the respect for their autonomy in IP-DM, before and after birth, and which principles regarding IP-DM are of cardinal importance for them?(4) Does access to birth settings differ geographically for Swiss women?",NA,external_funding,Active,4488797,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,427,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

"Scheiffele, Peter",NA,Departement Biozentrum; Departement Biozentrum / Cell Biology (Scheiffele),CANDY - Comorbid Analysis of Neurodevelopmental Disorders and Epilepsy,2019,"Early onset neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are common, frequently co-exist with other disorders, come at very high cost, and significantly reduce lifespan. For example, 10-15% of all people in Europe (i.e. 50 to 75 million individuals) are affected by NDDs such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Intellectual Disability (ID), motor problems and language disorders.  Moreover the number of affected individuals will likely increase - given the rising diagnostic rates of ASD and ADHD. The life-time health and economic burden of these NDDs exceeds that of cancer, stroke or dementia (Gustavsson 2011), and is significantly further increased by their frequent overlap in the same individual and lifetime persistence (Thapar 2017, and section 1.3). However, research spend on NDDs is less than 1% of that spend on cancer, stroke or dementia. These NDDs are also often associated with non-mental somatic diseases such as epilepsy, allergies, (auto-)immune and gastrointestinal (GI) diseases, motor problems, and visual and auditory handicaps (Muskens 2017, and section 1.3). Patients with ASD or ADHD or ID die on average 20 years younger than individuals in the general population, and this is further amplified by somatic multimorbidity, in particular epilepsy (Hirvikoski 2016; Dalsgaard 2015). Currently, there are no effective treatments for core symptoms of ASD and ID. Existing treatments for ADHD are symptomatic and do not affect either the underlying pathophysiology (which is unknown) or improve long-term outcome (Storebø 2015). The solution. There is hope, however. A recent fundamental conceptual shift in thinking about NDDs offers new opportunities. There is compelling evidence that some rare genetic variants (e.g. CNVs) increasing risk for ASD, ADHD, and ID are shared (Gonzalez-Mantilla 2016; Short 2018) and converge on relatively few final common pathways (Kiser 2015). Many of them impact on synaptic plasticity and glutamate and GABA neurotransmission (i.e., excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) balance) with downstream effects on brain function, cognitive development and risk for somatic multimorbidity, in particular epilepsy. Moreover, outcomes (i.e., symptom profile and severity) are likely moderated by genomic background and environmental factors acting at different time points (critical periods) (Di Filippo 2008). There is in particular emerging evidence that early maternal immune activation is a shared environmental risk factor across NDDs, and that its effect varies as a function of interactions between genetic and other environmental factors, such as nutrition and stress (al Haddad 2019; Knuesel 2014; Careaga 2016). Prenatal dietary and immunologic factors not only impact the fetal brain, but also affect the microbiota. Recent work suggests that the microbiota could be the missing link between environmental ""immune"" insults in prenatal life and future NDDs (Kelly 2017; Rudzki 2018; Kang 2018). The interaction between host genetics and gut microbiota could clarify why carrying risk-conferring common variants (i.e. from GWAS) only explain a small part of disease phenotypic variance of NDDs. Basically, carrying ""good"" bacteria may in principle overcome the deleterious effect of (i.e.) specific monoamine, glutamate or GABA signalling pathways. On the other hand, ""bad"" (i.e. pathogenic) bacteria could, in the same way, exacerbate symptomatology even if a protective genetic profile is present. This complex pattern of interaction affects not only neurotransmission (and its precursors) but also endocrine and neuroinflammatory processes observed in NDDs, as shown by us (Aarts 2017) and others (Strati 2017).",NA,external_funding,Active,4517373,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,430,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

These were collected during a large cross-sectional survey in 2015 that assessed antimalarial medicine use in a population of 6000 individuals in three Tanzanian regions with different ecological zones and malaria transmission intensity. The study comprised two types of cross-sectional surveys:- Household (HH)-based survey that included i) information on self-reported rates of morbidity, diagnosis and treatment seeking behaviour, diagnostic tests performed, antimalarial and antibiotic use, and ii) collection of Dried Blood Spots (DBS) to measure residual antimalarial concentration by broad-range tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) technology.- Health facilities (HF)-based survey of facilities that served the sampled HH; the survey included information on diagnostic tests in stock, treatment packages in stock (mainly antimalarial and antibiotics), and morbidity.Antibiotic concentration will be measured by LC-MS/MS method in the same samples (DBS) as those already assessed for antimalarial concentration. To address objective 3), a before-after design will be used. In the year prior to introduction of the e-POCT tool, a representative sample of children &lt;10 years will be interviewed using the same questionnaire as in previous HH survey. Blood samples will also be collected. Six months after e-POCT introduction, the same survey will be conducted 'during' the intervention (the large-scale implementation of e-POCT intervention will be paid through another funder). Antibiotic and antimalarial residual concentration will be measured in these samples before and after e-POCT implementation.Analytical approach1) Antibiotic use and pressure at the population level will be assessed according to different explanatory factors (rural-urban, age, gender, density of health facilities, other medicine retailers, medicine in stocks, malaria endemicity etc.)2) Bayesian geostatistical logistic regression models will be used to map the spatial distribution of antibiotic use and to predict the use at non-sampled locations via Bayesian kriging 3) Antibiotic and antimalarial use and pressure at the population level (children &lt;10 years) will be compared before and after implementation of e-POCT tool.Relevance and impact of the project- To tackle the global public health threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and address one of the specific step, namely improving global surveillance of antimicrobial consumption in humans as mentioned in the national strategic programme StAR, the WHO Global Action Plan and the UK final report and recommendations on AMR- To provide an inovative standardized and reliable approach to quantify real antibiotic and antimalarial drug use and pressure at the community level- To provide a new tool to assess the impact of interventions aimed at improving the rational use of medicines (antibiotics and antimalarials)",NA,external_funding,Active,4439827,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,434,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"Nachtwey, Oliver","Hardering, Friedericke",Departement Gesellschaftswissenschaften / Sozialstrukturanalyse (Nachtwey),Digital alienation and appropriation of work: Experiences of alienation in digital service work,2019,"The digitization of the working world can be understood as a driver of a fundamental structural change in work. Many questions have arisen about the increase of heteronomy when using algorithms, about the loss of work time autonomy, about new forms of work fragmentation, or about changes in social relationships. In order to grasp such problematic developments, current discourse has come to employ the keyword 'alienation' to describe the changes of work in a digital age. The value of such a concept in the context of digital work lies in an exploration of problems that go beyond possible losses of autonomy and include questions such as the loss of meaning in work, changing social relationships in work contexts, as well as changing self-conceptualizations. So far, elaborations on the concept of alienation and its potentials have been mostly limited to social-philosophical works. An empirical analysis of the concept in the field of digital work remains largely absent. This project seeks to remedy this by examining digital alienation in detail, focusing on experiences of alienation and appropriation efforts of workers at various levels of qualification in digital forms of work. Because alienation was mainly investigated in low-skilled fields of industrial work in the past, little is known about the alienation potentials of digital service work. To close this gap, the project examines digital service work in the old and new, digital economy. The aim of the project is the development of an empirically founded concept of digital alienation in work. A central question is in how far digital work across a number of different occupational groups in the service sector correlates to specific experiences of alienation. This is done by using an innovative form of access to subjective alienation experiences that differs between several levels of experiences of alienation (biographical, body-emotional, practically-acting, critical-evaluative). The study aims at garnering insights into the experiences of employees at different levels of qualification in order to retrace the ways in which alienation potentials in digital work are interpreted and coped with. This will lead to the development of a new, profound definition of digital alienation directly relating to worker experiences.A qualitative research approach is used in which interviews and group discussions with employees in service work are conducted. It examines highly qualified, qualified and low-skilled employees in the field of service work. By this, the project combines theoretical, methodological and empirical questions of alienation research and aims to reconceptualize alienation as a category of sociology of work.

"Goedecker, Stefan",NA,Departement Physik / Physik (Goedecker),Development of a Neural Network Potential with Accurate Electrostatic Interactions,2019,"In recent years, a new generation of interatomic potentials based on machine learning techniques has been introduced. These potentials, which provide a direct functional relation between the atomic positions and the potential-energy, combine the accuracy of electronic structure methods with the efficiency of simple empirical potentials. Because of the absence of system-specific terms they allow to perform extended simulations of a large variety of systems. Most of these potentials rely on atomic properties like energies and charges depending only on the local chemical environments of the atoms. Such local charges are, however, unable to capture long-range charge transfer. This prevents the accurate description of systems in which distant structural features have global effects on the charge distribution in the system. Examples for such systems are semiconductors including defects, polar surfaces of oxides and metal-organic molecules with different possible metal oxidation states. In order to overcome these intrinsic limitations of current machine learning potentials, we propose to combine high-dimensional neural networks with the charge equilibration neural network technique.

Remodeling and fibrosis stimulated by inflammation appear to be main factors for the progression of HFpEF. The lack of treatment options in HFpEF urgently calls for new therapeutic approaches. While beneficial effects of exercise training have been demonstrated in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, they have not yet been sufficiently evaluated in HFpEF. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of high-intensity interval training on the exercise tolerance of HFpEF patients. The primary outcome exercise tolerance will be measured as peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak). Methods: The proposed study will be a prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled trial in a primary care setting, including 86 patients with stable HFpEF. Patients will undergo two study visits including measurements of disease-specific biomarkers, cardiac and arterial vessel structure and function, exercise tolerance, habitual physical activity, and quality of life. After the first visit, patients will be randomized into the intervention or control group. The intervention group (n=43) will attend a supervised 12-week high-intensity interval training on a bicycle ergometer. The control group (n=43) will participate in a 12-week moderate-intensity continuous training. After 12 weeks, the study measurements will be repeated in all patients to monitor the effects of the intervention. At 6 months, 1, 2 and 3 years after the intervention, telephone interviews will be performed to assess medical outcomes and quality of life. Discussion: This study is expected to add important knowledge about the potential utility of a novel treatment strategy in HFpEF patients, which may help to improve quality of life, functional status, and prognosis.","Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, High-intensity interval training, Exercise tolerance, Therapy response prediction",external_funding,Active,4500621,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,437,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Although it is well understood that this process is controlled by regulatory proteins that can switch genes on and off by binding to short sequences in the DNA, there is still an enormous gap in our understanding between experimentally determined lists of components on the one hand, and idealized mathematical models on the other hand. In a major development, it has become possible over the last few years to experimentally quantitatively track the states of individual cells across tissues and embryos as they are developing, measuring how much each gene is expressed, the state of the DNA, which cells derived from the same ancestor cell, and so on. These methods promise to revolutionize our ability to understand the ways in which a single genome can be expressed into a complex organism. However, there are many challenges on the way to realizing this promise. For example, single cell measurements are very noisy, with many missing values. Most importantly, it is currently unclear how the measured state of a single cell can be related to the actions of the regulatory proteins that guide the process. Therefore, novel computational methods are needed that allow bridging the gap between mathematical models and single-cell measurements. The goals of the project are to develop new mathematical and computational methods for the analysis of genome-wide gene expression and DNA state measurements in single cells. In particular, we propose to develop new statistical models for carefully distinguishing true biological variability from measurement noise. Moreover, we propose to adapt a previously developed method for relating the measured state of a cell to the activities of regulatory proteins to be applied to single cells. The methods we propose should make it possible to precisely quantify the activities of regulatory proteins in single cells, and to map the landscapes that guide the states of cells. The results of our work will consist of a suite of tools that can be used by researchers worldwide. Our project involves several collaborations with experimentalists at the forefront of developing these single cell measurements, and application of our methods to data generated in the labs will guide further refinement of our methods. The methods we propose will make a major contribution to realizing the promise of single-cell methodologies for unraveling how a single genome is expressed into a complex multi-cellular organization.

Current ICI are blocking antibodies that target immune checkpoints including PD-1 and CTLA-4. ICI are the proof of principle that a dysfunctional immune system can be re-activated against an established tumor. However, only a minority of patients responds to the currently available ICI. New strategies to target additional pathways to reverse cancer-associated immune suppression are therefore needed.Others and my group within the Cancer Immunology Laboratory in Basel have defined a new adaptive, immunosuppressive pathway, the sialoglycan-Siglec-9 pathway that involves sialic-acid binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec) receptor 9 and upregulation of sialic acid-containing Siglec ligands (sialoglycans) in the tumor microenvironment. We have also recently described and upregulation of the inhibitory Siglec-9 receptor on tumor-infiltrating T cells.The general objective of this project is to delineate the role of Siglec receptors and Siglec ligands in adaptive anti-tumor immunity and to generate tools to target Siglec receptors and their ligands for cancer immunotherapy. First, we will elucidate Siglec signalling in tumor-infiltrating T cells. We will generate a defined Jurkat cell line overexpressing different Siglec receptor variants to elucidate their downstream signaling. To further understand signaling and pathways influenced by inhibitory Siglec receptors on tumor-infiltrating T cells, we will use these defined cell lines to perform an unbiased proteomic analysis. These findings will help to understand how Siglec-9 inhibits T cell function in cancer. Second, we will study the role of Siglecs on dendritic cells in anti-tumor immunity and also autoimmunity with new mouse models. We will perform multicolor flow cytometric analysis on non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and epithelial ovarian cancer samples as well as tumor-draining lymph nodes to characterize Siglec expression on human dendritic cells in cancer patients. In addition, we will use genetic mouse models to study the function of Siglecs on dendritic cells in cancer and autoimmunity. Finally, in collaboration with Carolyn Bertozzi at Stanford, agents that target Siglec receptors and their ligands in cancer will be developed. Already established preclinical models will be used for combination immunotherapy regimens together with established ICI and mechanisms of anti-tumor immune activation will be studied in vivo.With the proposed research project, we will improve our understanding for the role of the Siglec-sialoglycan immunosuppressive pathway in cancer patients. We have produced a set of tools for in vitro and in vivo studies of the sialoglycan-Siglec pathway that will significantly move potential compounds further in the preclinical and hopefully into future clinical development.

"Herren-Oesch, Madeleine",NA,Europainstitut; Europainstitut / Neuere europäische Geschichte (Herren-Oesch),The Divisive Power of Citizenship,2019,"Erosion of nationality and the politicization of citizenship have become dominant features of discourse in Western democracies. However, these issues are not new: since the beginning of the 21st century Western states have been loosening historic hurdles to de-naturalization of their citizens, mainly as a consequence of the War on Terror and stricter treatment of migrants. In addition to this re-framing of citizenship - as a privilege that can be lost - supra-national organizations pose orthogonal challenges. For example, the European Union grants its citizens free movement, thereby relaxing the historic connection between citizenship and geographical region and replacing nationality with a new form of multi-layered citizenship. This project, ""The Divisive Power of Citizenship"", seeks to relate and connect these recent processes effectively with historical precedents to create an expanded understanding of citizenship which can both reveal new insights about the past as well as the contemporary situation. Focusing on East Asia in the early 20th century, we examine conditions applying to European merchants, whose citizenship bestowed distinct jurisdiction and rights compared with their Asian contemporaries - creating multilayered trans-cultural communities. Such competing communities can be analyzed in terms of colonial privilege, racism and nationalism, affording new perspectives on historical communities and also provide a lens through which to view the tumultuous processes at work today.

"Cajochen, Christian",NA,Bereich Psychiatrie (Klinik) / Erwachsenenpsychiatrie UPK,Using a visual display controlling melanopic irradiance to regulate sleep,2019,"Daily exposure to environmental light-dark cycles is fundamental for the regulation of circadian sleep-wake rhythms, alertness levels and cognitive performance. These non-image forming effects (NIF) of light are mediated in part by the photopigment melanopsin, located in intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) in the retina. The spectral sensitivity of the ipRGCs is distinct from any aspect of conventional vision and peaks around 480nm, which coincides with the widely used LED spectral characteristics of visual displays in our days. Altering irradiance in the blue range (460-480nm) does indeed impact NIF responses under laboratory and more natural conditions, but such manipulations currently also change colour (e.g. ""Night Shift"" on iOS). We have pioneered more sophisticated approaches involving custom-made metameric light sources for displays and general illumination. Those recently patented and patent pending technical approaches allow for selective modulation of melanopsin without impacting visual appearance. This represents a powerful new tool to understand the importance of melanopsin for NIF responses and a potential intervention to control these effects in the real world.Overall objective:We will test the effects of a melanopic-display, a new technology that has the potential to regulate the NIF impact of visual displays without affecting their visual appearance, human sleep.Specific aims:We hypothesize that visual contents presented via the melanopic-display in a low melanopic (LM) mode in the evening will not aversively affect sleep, while those presented in a high melanopic mode (HM) will attenuate the evening increase in melatonin, lengthen sleep onset and reduce the proportion of electroencephalographic (EEG) deep sleep in the night following exposure. If the data support our hypothesis, this will allow using LM displays and light sources in the evening, which fulfil optimal condition for vision without affecting sleep. We hypothesize that controlling melanopic irradiance allows an opportunity to control sleep and related NIF responses independent of any effect on the activity of photopic, cone-based vision. The outcome of these studies will allow to determine the utility of modulating melanopic irradiance, which is currently recommended by the international commission on illumination (CIE) and Deutsches Institut für Normung e.V. (DIN), and also define the effectiveness of this strategy compared to the traditional approach of regulating 'visual brightness' (photopic lux).A parallel set of experiments in animals will establish the mechanism behind such an effect. Greater responses to HM vs LM would imply a dominant influence of melanopsin. However, in humans it is not possible to exclude the alternative possibility that they reflect residual differences in cone or rod activity between the two conditions. We will be able to distinguish these alternatives in mice by asking whether differences in response to HM and LM stimuli are absent in melanopsin knockout (Opn4-/-) mice. Methods: This work relies upon a visual Display, developed by Robert Lucas, University of Manchester, in which we will be able to independently modulate the effective irradiance for cones vs. melanopsin. Healthy volunteers will undergo a 17-h laboratory study under different lighting conditions and intensive physiological (polysomnography), endocrinological and neurocognitive measurements. We will consider the two routes via which light can impact sleep onset time: adjustments in circadian phase and direct effects on behavioural state. We will be able to use versions of the melanopic display designed according to the characteristics of the mouse visual system to present HM and LM stimuli in wild type and Opn4-/- mice in established paradigms testing circadian phase resetting and control of sleep.Expected results: If the melanopic-device approach has the expected effects, light induced changes in circadian phase and sleep/arousal will be higher in HM vs LM conditions in humans and wild type mice, but not Opn4-/- animals.Impact: It would, for the first time, answer the question whether sleep-wake cycles exclusively respond to spectral components of light mediated by melanopsin or not and whether melanopic-displays could be applied to minimise their negative effects on alertness and sleep, and beneficially affect sleep instead.

Current protocols for tissue imaging with cellular resolution involve optical and electron microscopies. Here, three-dimensional imaging requires serial sectioning due to the limited penetration depth. Sectioning, however, is destructive and artifact prone, with insufficient spatial resolution (perpendicular to the cuts) for visualizing cells. In the last decade, hard X-ray tomography has created virtual histology for imaging biological tissues with isotropic voxels at the micrometer scale and below. The question now arises: what is the highest achievable resolution for an atlas of the entire human brain? Currently, the best atlas is based on histological sectioning with 20 µm-wide voxels. Recent studies using synchrotron radiation-based hard X rays have imaged a full mouse brain with 0.8 µm pixel size, but the volume of a human brain is 3,000 times larger.The goal of this project is to generate an atlas of the entire human brain with 1 µm resolution. Hierarchical synchrotron radiation-based X-ray imaging will be performed at the beamline BM18 (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility - ESRF, Grenoble, France), which is under construction and will be unique with respect to beam size and transversal coherence. Here, full-field tomography of the entire human brain with voxel sizes of 20 µm and stitched local tomography acquisitions can be combined. The high-resolution imaging of the at least 12 cm-wide human brain poses several challenges, including sample preparation to withstand extreme radiation dose, acquisition protocols to keep the beamtime within limits, and data processing, which comprises slices of 100 GB and a total volume in the PB range.As the synchrotron radiation-based high-resolution X-ray measurements of the human brain can only be performed post mortem, we will make a correspondence from the ex vivo conditions back to the in vivo case in order to put this dataset into a more physiologically relevant context. Non-rigid registration of lower resolution magnetic resonance images of the human brain taken before extraction and throughout the fixation process allow for the quantification of the local deformations introduced during extraction, fixation, and embedding.

"Handschin, Christoph",NA,Departement Biozentrum / Growth & Development (Handschin),Molecular mechanisms controlling the crosstalk between skeletal muscle and neurons,2019,"Skeletal muscle exhibits an enormous cellular plasticity to adapt to external and internal stimuli. For example, exercise triggers a pleiotropic adaptation in metabolic and contractile properties in muscle fibers, angiogenesis and increased vascularization within muscle tissue, as well as systemic metabolic remodeling in various other organs. Even though exercise exerts numerous health benefits, the molecular mechanisms that control muscle cell plasticity are still poorly understood. In particular, it is largely unclear how long-term adaptations of training are controlled, e.g. those related to the remodeling of the neuromuscular junction. Our grant aims at elucidating the transcriptional networks that control muscle cell identity in acute exercise and chronic exercise training. Preliminary data indicate that epigenetic adaptations in trained muscle might facilitate the gene expression changes elicited by individual exercise bouts. Besides a general analysis of these networks using a combination of next generation sequencing approaches and computational predictions, we will also specifically focus on potential mediators of a crosstalk between muscle fibers and neurons. We have previously published a hitherto unexpected retrograde effect of muscle on morphological and functional aspects of the motor neuron, mediated by so-far unknown effectors. Moreover, preliminary findings describing a potent effect of exercise and muscle peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#947; coactivator 1&#945; (PGC-1&#945;), a regulatory nexus of endurance exercise adaptation, on motor coordination and balance, and hence presumably proprioceptive and/or vestibular input indicate an even more extensive retrograde signaling between muscle and neuronal circuits. We thus plan to study the interaction of the neuromuscular, proprioceptive and vestibular systems, and to identify the respective mediators in this crosstalk. Retro- and anterograde mapping of proprioceptive and vestibular input on specific motor neuron pools will allow a fine-grained quantification of changes in these systems.

"Spang, Anne",NA,Departement Biozentrum / Biochemistry (Spang),Elucidation of mechanisms of Arf1-dependent cellular processes,2019,"The ability to communicate with and to sense the environment is essential for cells. Exo- and endocytosis are the processes promoting the discharge and uptake of proteins, lipids and other molecules at the plasma membrane, respectively. These processes are controlled by small GTPases mainly of the Arf and Rab family. At the same time signaling events occur at the plasma membrane that may drive the internalization of receptors and will subsequently lead to the termination of the initial signal transduction. Likewise, external cues read by receptors in the plasma membrane can influence membrane transport event. Thus, there is a crosstalk between membrane traffic and signaling. In recent years, however, it became clear that this crosstalk may be more complicated and intense and that small GTPases, such Arf1, may operate beyond their canonical functions We have been working on the elucidation of different Arf1 functions. One feature that stood out was that Arf1 is important for the subcellular localization of a subset of mRNAs, and that in an arf1 mutant, some RNAs became better translated, even though translation was generally attenuated, and processing body (PB) formation was increased. PBs are the major decay compartment in yeast. To gain more insights, we performed next generation sequencing (NGS) on total RNA and ribosome associated mRNA (Riboseq) in an arf1 mutant and wild type. The NGS analysis extended the knowledge on differentially translated mRNAs. More importantly, two processes stood out that were extremely affected in the arf1 mutant.Pathways that were the most strongly upregulated would yield an increase in methylation. We confirmed the hits and that the methyl donor (AdoMet) is increased in arf1 mutant cells. However, we do not know what molecular species are methylated. We can exclude so far lipids and histones. Nothing is known about the connection between Arf1 and methylation. Therefore, we will determine in the first aim the molecules that are methylated and the responsible methyltransferases. From there, we will determine the mechanism and signaling pathway that leads to the increase of methylation. The most downregulated pathways were connected to ribosome biogenesis and amino acid metabolism. The regulation of these pathways are hallmarks of TORC1 signaling. Therefore, we will determine in the second aim how Arf1 controls TORC1 signaling. Even though, it was proposed that Arf1 controls TORC1 signaling in Drosophila, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In the third aim, we will aim to understand how mRNAs are recruited into PBs under various stress conditions and how the decision is made between storage and decay in PBs. In this aim, we will capitalize on our recently established method to purify PBs to determine the mRNA and protein content and combine this with Riboseq.

Special values of classical transcendental functions, such asthe exponential function, Weierstrass functions, and modular forms,are a rich source of points of arithmetic significance. Thesespecial points include roots of unity, points of finite orderon abelian varieties, and special points on Shimura varieties. TheConjectures of Manin-Mumford and André-Oort, now known to be true inmany important cases, underscore a striking similarity between specialpoints and rational points. Recent work also suggests a deepconnection between special points and integral points. This connectionis less well understood and lies outside the scope of theaforementioned conjectures. One purpose of this proposal is toinvestigate special points through the lens of Lang's Conjecture onintegral points. Furthermore, there are intriguing connections toergodic theory and dynamical systems. Another focus are the morerecent, and largely open, conjectures on unlikely intersections. Theyare due independently to Bombieri--Masser--Zannier, Pink, and Zilberand go the beyond the conjectures above in a different way. They havebeen the source of many positive interactions between number theoryand model theory.","Special points, Integral points, Mahler measure, Heights, Abelian varieties, Number Theory, Torsion points, Diophantine Geometry",external_funding,Active,4500640,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,448,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

It builds on previous research from our group in this field and on the analysis of current gaps and challenges. The proposal is divided into four independent Work Packages (WP), wherein different types of chiral catalysts will be employed. WP1 is dedicated to the development of an enantioselective method to synthesize axially chiral spirocycles, involving a double C(sp3)-H arylation and the desymmetrization of enantiotopic methyl groups in the enantiodetermining step. This method should provide a straightforward access to original spirocyclic molecules wherein the stereogenic axis is the sole stereogenic element. In WP2, we will investigate the yet unexplored kinetic resolution of racemic reactants by Pd0-catalyzed activation of sp2 and sp3 C-H bonds in the presence of a chiral catalyst. Ideally, both enantiomers of the corresponding cyclic products could be formed by reacting the remaining enantiomer in the presence of an achiral catalyst. Applications to the synthesis of polycyclic natural products are envisaged for selected cases. The main purpose of WP3, for which we already have very significant preliminary results, is the Pd0-catalyzed functionalization of enantiotopic secondary C-H bonds. These are less reactive than primary ones and more challenging to activate, but lead to the creation of a stereocenter at the activated site and have a great application potential. The use of C2-symmetric N-heterocyclic carbenes of the IBiox family should allow achieving high enantioselectivities for a range of synthetically appealing carbo- and heterocyclic products. The developed methods will be applied to the synthesis of selected natural products such as indidene C. WP4 is dedicated to the development of the intermolecular enantioselective C-H functionalization of enantiotopic secondary C-H bonds. The use of palladium(0) instead of the more established palladium(II) catalysis would enable cross-couplings with a variety of compatible electrophiles.

The transcription factor T cell factor 1 (Tcf1) is necessary and at least partially sufficient to confer CD8 T cells with self-renewal capacity. Accordingly, Tcf1+ memory CD8 T cells represent the cellular substrate, which yields expanded populations of terminally differentiated effector cells upon anti-PD1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibition. We remain, however, in need of strategies whereby to augment the pool of Tcf1+ stem-cell-like memory CD8 T cells. Working hypothesis: I) Based on our preliminary data we aim to identify key factors that serve to augment Tcf1 expression and thereby foster stem-cell-like CD8 T cell memory formation in the chronic infection context. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that these key factors counter-balance inflammatory stimuli such as type I interferons and interleukin-12, which promote terminal differentiation of CD8 T cells through STAT4-mediated Tcf1 repression. We speculate that STAT4 is part of a negative feedback loop to sustain critical levels of Tcf1 and to enable the formation of self-renewing CD8 T cell memory. II) As the infection progresses into its chronic phase, the aforementioned key signals become scarce and self-renewing CD8 memory T cells get deprived of Tcf1-promoting signaling. Accordingly, exogenous supplementation of these key signals has the potential to augment the pool of Tcf1+ memory CD8 T cells, and to restore antiviral immune control in persistent infection.Experimental models and methods: The role of Tcf1-supporting factors be studied in the mouse model of chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection. Sensing of Tcf1-promoting factors and Tcf1 levels in adoptively transferred antiviral CD8 T cells will be modulated by constitutive or conditional gene deletion as well as by transgenic and retroviral gene supplementation. We will combine genome-wide transcriptome analyses, TaqMan RT-PCR technology, cutting-edge multi-color flow cytometry and recombinant adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-based protein delivery with state-of-the-art immunological and virological assessments.Specific aims: To define the role of Tcf1 promoting signals in the chronic viral infection context we aim to:1. Corroborate and mechanistically decipher the role of these signals for the formation of Tcf1-expressing stem-cell-like memory CD8 T cells.2. Explore the utility and potential of immunotherapies for augmenting the stem-cell-like pool of Tcf1-expressing memory CD8 T cells in chronic infection.Significance: These studies in a relevant small animal model are designed to substantially advance our understanding of stem cell-like T cell differentiation in chronic viral infection. Ultimately, they aim at delineating a strategy to augment the pool of stem-like memory CD8 T cells.

While animal cells are less plastic than plant cells, an increasing number of molecules, especially transcription factors, have been identified that are capable of reprogramming cell lineages.   This plasticity is, however, associated with an inherent instability of the differentiated or reprogrammed states. Therefore, it is of major interest to unravel mechanisms that can stabilize the desired cell phenotypes. Transcriptional positive feedback loops have been often suggested to stabilize phenotypes, a claim supported by well-characterized molecular mechanisms to support bistability in simpler organisms. Recent evidence suggests, however, that chromosomal regulatory landscapes can also support epigenetic inheritance and differentiation. This project aims at unveiling whether and to what extent these two mechanisms contribute to the neuronal differentiation and the stability of neuronal phenotypes. By focusing on neurogenic transcription factors, we will examine whether they orchestrate transcriptional feedback loops and assess their ability to support bistable phenotypes. Concurrently, we will explore the correlation between phenotypic diversity and the changes in the chromosomal regulatory landscape. In the second subproject, we will use tools of synthetic biology to dissect the components of the chromosomal regulatory landscape to characterize the minimal set of elements that can promote phenotypic diversification through the control of the interdependence in the stochastic expression of the genes in a chromosomal segment.    Our experimental systems analysis will shed light on the control principles that can stabilize differentiated or reprogrammed cell states, which will help to engineer neurons with precise functioning for ex vivo studies and for therapeutic applications. ",NA,external_funding,Active,4500646,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,451,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"Schärer, Lukas",NA,Departement Umweltwissenschaften / Evolutionary Biology (Schärer),Sexual selection and sexual conflict in simultaneous hermaphrodites with divergent mating syndromes,2019,"Mating interactions in copulating simultaneous hermaphrodites involve sexual conflicts over the preferred mating role, leading to sexually antagonistic coevolution between male persistence and female resistance traits. Specifically, since fitness often increases more gradually for the male role, individuals may prefer sperm donation over sperm receipt once they have obtained enough sperm to fertilize their available eggs. Theory suggests two types of conflict resolution, which involve contrasting mating interactions and reproductive adaptations. One type of resolution-characterized by the reciprocal mating syndrome-involves mating simultaneously in both sex roles in a mating posture that resembles a handshake. Here individuals receive sperm whenever they donate sperm, leading to sexual conflict over the fate of the received ejaculate, and thus favouring donor traits that force recipients to use their sperm and recipient traits that allow recipients to retain control over sperm use. Another type of resolution-characterized by the hypodermic mating syndrome-involves forced (unilateral) sperm donation. Here the donor injects sperm into the mating partner via a traumatic route, thus favouring donor traits permitting efficient injection and movement of hypodermic sperm, and recipient traits that permit avoidance of such matings and their associated costs.Specific aims: I propose to study these mating syndromes in the free-living flatworm genus Macrostomum, which we have recently shown to exhibit at least 7 convergent transitions from the reciprocal to the hypodermic mating syndrome among the currently &gt;100 Macrostomum analysed species. Specifically, I propose to:1)identify reproductive candidate genes in several selected species across the Macrostomum phylogeny using positional RNA-Seq2)mine whole-body transcriptomes of &gt;100 Macrostomum species for reproductive candidate genes with mating-syndrome-specific patterns of presence/absence, gene expression and sequence evolution3) perform gene expression analyses and functional tests on identified reproductive candidate genes using in situ hybridization and RNA interference in multiple species4)establish draft genomes of two closely related Macrostomum species that show divergent mating syndromes using state-of-the-art long-read NGS approaches5)use that genome information to establish transgenic lines expressing fluorescent protein markers in genes coding for transcripts with ubiquitous and testis/sperm-specific expression6)use these transgenic lines to study postcopulatory sexual selection and sperm function in both the reciprocally and hypodermically mating speciesWider scientific context: Simultaneous hermaphrodites that engage in copulation represent one of many different possible outcomes of the sexual cascade, a recently proposed evolutionary framework that aims to understand the emergence of complex sexual phenotypes as a result of a series of evolutionary transitions. The research I propose here investigates one such transition, namely shifts between the reciprocal and hypodermic mating syndromes. Since this transition has occurred convergently many times in the studied clade-consistent with predictions from current sexual selection and sexual conflict theory for hermaphrodites-the proposed research offers a unique opportunity to evaluate statistically the genomic consequences that result from this transition, informing research on traumatic mating in other organismal groups. Moreover, using two newly established Macrostomum model organisms, one for each mating syndrome, we can perform experimental tests of specific sexual selection and sexual conflict processes, allowing insights into the evolutionary forces that are responsible for driving such transitions.",antagonistic coevolution; phylogenomics; sperm competition; comparative genomics; sex allocation; sperm morphology; transcriptome sequencing; functional genomics; simultaneous hermaphrodite; comparative analysis; anisogamy; genome sequencing,external_funding,Active,4500648,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,452,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"Voss, Till",NA,Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH); Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH) / Gene Regulation (Voss),Revisiting singular var gene choice in malaria parasites using CRISPR-Cas9 technology,2019,"The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum proliferates in the blood stream through consecutive rounds of red blood cell (RBC) invasion and intracellular multiplication. During each replication cycle some parasites cease to multiply and differentiate into gametocytes, which are essential for malaria transmission via the mosquito vector. Antigenic variation allows the parasite to escape adaptive immune responses during blood infection and hence to establish chronic infection and secure onward transmission to other human hosts. The major clonally variant antigen is known as P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) and is exposed on the surface of infected RBCs (iRBCs). In addition to facilitating immune evasion, PfEMP1 also mediates the sequestration of iRBCs in deep tissue, which contributes strongly to the development of severe pathology. PfEMP1 is encoded by the var gene family comprising 60 genes, which are all located in transcriptionally silenced heterochromatic regions of the genome. One single var gene escapes silencing and becomes activated to express the corresponding PfEMP1 variant. Antigenic variation of PfEMP1 is brought about through in situ switches in the mutually exclusive activation of var genes. Despite extensive research in this field the regulatory mechanisms securing the activation of only a single var gene are still largely unknown. However, several lines of evidence indicate that this process may take place in a unique dedicated var gene expression site (VES) at the nuclear periphery. Here, I propose to use CRIPSR-Cas9-based approaches to test this model and to identify and characterise the factors responsible for singular var gene choice.One major part of the research proposed here will focus on the functional analysis of the histone methyltransferase PfSET10. PfSET10 is an epigenetic regulator known to be involved in var gene activation and the only protein known so far to localise exclusively to the proposed VES structure. We will employ conditional expression systems to either induce or deplete the expression of tagged PfSET10. Fluorescence microscopy and transcriptional profiling experiments will be used to assess if PfSET10 is sufficient and/or required for var gene activation. We will use ChIP-seq experiments to test if PfSET10 associates exclusively with the active var locus or if it also targets other virulence genes for activation in the VES. We will use PfSET10 as a bait to identify and characterise additional components of the VES by protein mass spectrometry followed by functional analyses. To complement these experiments, we will use CasID, a recently established method for the in vivo biotinylation of chromatin-associated proteins at specific genomic sites, as an unbiased approach to identify factors associated with the active var gene promoter. We will also attempt gaining insight into the mechanisms controlling mutually exclusive var gene expression by comparing var gene transcription and PfSET10 expression between asexual parasites and gametocytes, the latter of which do not express PfEMP1. The results anticipated from this comprehensive and purposeful set of approaches will deliver unprecedented insight into the mechanisms that regulate mutually exclusive var gene activation and thereby facilitate expression and antigenic variation of the major virulence factor of P. falciparum malaria parasites.",NA,external_funding,Active,4500649,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,453,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Here I propose to use a genome-wide CRISPR knockout library to screen potential tumor suppressors in implanted mouse HCC models. The mouse hepatocytes depleted of different mTOR pathway components, with differential mTOR activities, will be separately infected with the CRISPR knockout library and implanted into immunocompromised mice to induce tumor.

Parasitism also acts a 2-way street: As host populations evolve in response to selection imposed by their parasites, so too does the parasite evolve in response to its host. This antagonistic coevolution between host and parasite may generate much of the genetic diversity found in natural populations, and is likely a strong driver of local adaptation and population differentiation. Host-parasite coevolution is also of enormous practical concern for human society, as parasites impose considerable costs in respect to agriculture, livestock production, aquaculture, and human health. Unfortunately though, very little empirical evidence is available to evaluate some of the most fundamental predictions of coevolutionary theory, especially in respect to the genomic basis of coevolution, as past studies of antagonistic coevolution have typically been conducted at the phenotypic level, or using simplified host-parasite systems in a laboratory setting.

Drawing inspiration from Nature, this project aims to address this issue by providing an innovative protocol for the automated synthesis of complex natural product-like scaffolds.

The Burke group's small molecule synthesizer will thus be used to rapidly assemble linear terpenoid precursors, which will then be subjected to tail-to-head terpene cyclization via the Tiefenbacher group's catalyst to form cyclized terpenoid structures.

Although, aging is driven by limitations in somatic maintenance, it is also subject to regulation by evolutionarily highly conserved molecular pathways. Indeed, macromolecular damage may drive the functional decline with aging; however, a battery of conserved, longevity assurance mechanisms may set the pace on how rapidly damage builds up and function is lost over time. Human efforts over the last centuries have succeeded in substantially lengthening lifespan, allowing aging to become a common feature of western societies.

However, the outcomes of Notch signal activation are remarkably varied depending on cellular context, including in different tumor types. Understanding the basis of Notch tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressive activities is a prerequisite for designing efficacious therapeutic agents that target Notch signaling and for implementing them in the treatment of cancer. Malignant gliomas are the most common and aggressive primary brain cancers, and the prognosis for glioma patients is very poor. Although we start to understand some of the causes of glioma in humans, current therapies are not effective. These tumors are still invariably lethal and therefore there remains much to be learnt and new therapeutic targets to be discovered. Treatment options for glioma patients remain very limited, which is in part attributed to the presence of therapy-resistant glioma stem cells. Notch signaling has been implicated in the development of brain tumors, primarily by virtue of its stem cell promoting activity and well-established role in supporting maintenance and self-renewal of neural stem cells during brain development and in the adult. This has made Notch pathway components compelling targets for the development of new drugs, some of which have already progressed into the clinic. However, the role of Notch in glioma formation remains controversial. Some data indicate that the Notch pathway can be oncogenic in glioma by promoting survival, radio-resistance and stem cell character within these tumors. In contrast, other experimental evidences indicate that Notch activity can promote a less proliferative glioma phenotype, which leads to less aggressive tumors. Inactivating Notch mutations similar to those identified in epithelial cancers have also been detected in subtypes of human glioma, in line with Notch being tumor-suppressive. The source of this heterogeneity in the responses to Notch activity remains puzzling, but it is becoming clear that human gliomas are heterogeneous entities that differ at the genetic, epigenetic and transcriptional levels. Whether Notch signaling has a different or perhaps even opposite role in distinct forms of the disease has not been rigorously addressed. Our research has focused on studying Notch signaling in neural stem cell maintenance and brain tumor formation and we have made important contributions to these fields. Our preliminary genetic data in multiple mouse models of human glioma represent proof of principle experiments demonstrating that Notch can be either tumor-promoting or tumor-suppressive in distinct glioma entities in vivo and provide a potential rationale for this context-dependency, which may have dramatic implications for glioma therapy in humans. The proposed project will address the cellular and molecular mechanisms behind Notch oncogenic and tumor-suppressive functions in glioma. Conditional gene deletion experiments will address the interaction between known glioma drivers and Notch activity, and how distinct oncogenic alterations can skew the outcome of Notch activation towards tumor-promoting or tumor-suppressive effects.

The rollout of antiretroviral treatment (ART) has led to a dramatic reduction in HIV/AIDS-associated deaths, but resulted in a remarkable increase of cardiovascular mortality. Arterial hypertension is the most prevalent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The Sub-Saharan African region is particularly burdened by both diseases, with both the prevalence of HIV and the prevalence of arterial hypertension rates exceeding those of most other regions. Management of arterial hypertension in sub-Saharan Africa, especially in rural settings, remains poor due to low awareness in communities and among health workers, lack of screening programs, high cost of antihypertensive medication and the general lack of evidence regarding optimal antihypertensive treatment for Africans living in sub-Saharan Africa. Rationale. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends starting treatment of arterial hypertension with a thiazide diuretic and adding a calcium antagonist if the target blood pressure is not achieved. Newer antihypertensive drugs and treatment strategies are available but have never been compared to the WHO approach in Africa. With the proposed randomized controlled trial, we aim at closing this evidence gap, comparing the current standard of care WHO algorithm with two alternative treatment strategies aiming at rapid control of arterial hypertension: a dual combination of thiazide diuretic and an angiotensin-receptor blocker, and a low-dose triple combination with optional dose titration. Overall objectives. To inform future guidelines and policies on care for patients with arterial hypertension in sub-Saharan Africa. Specific aims. The main objective is to conduct in an open-label, two-country, controlled randomized trial to assess three antihypertensive treatment strategies in HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients: the current WHO-recommended treatment and two alternatives, potentially more cost-effective treatments. The trial will focus on patients with uncomplicated arterial hypertension. It will be conducted in partnering hospitals in Tanzania and Lesotho and compare both the effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of the three strategies. The primary outcome is reaching a target blood pressure of £130/80mmHg for patients aged &lt;65years and £140/90mmHg for patients aged ³65years within 12 weeks of treatment initiation. As secondary objectives we will assess mean reduction of blood pressure at different time points, clinical outcomes such as mortality, major cardiovascular events and surrogate markers of clinical outcomes (proteinuria, creatinine, retinopathy, hypertensive heart disease). We will also assess adverse events and the cost-effectiveness of the three treatment strategies over a 24-week period and the comparability of different blood pressure measurement techniques in this setting. Expected results. We expect to generate evidence on the most effective and cost-effective pharmacologic treatment strategies for patients with uncomplicated arterial hypertension in resource-limited settings in rural Africa. Furthermore, we will contribute knowledge to additional aspects of care for arterial hypertension, such as optimal approach for blood-pressure measurement and assessment of clinical surrogate markers. Impact of the study. The proposed randomized trial will inform future guidelines on management of arterial hypertension in sub-Saharan Africa and contribute to policies on blood pressure control in resource-limited settings.","Hypertension, sub-Saharan Africa, drug treatment",external_funding,Active,4500627,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,466,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"Taylor, Verdon",NA,Departement Biomedizin / Embryology and Stem Cell Biology (Taylor),RAinRARE - Multilevel analyses of retinoic acid signaling to understand and treat a rare form of progressive,2019,"De novo mutations in the RARb gene, which codes for the retinoic acid receptor beta (RARb), cause a severe and progressive form of early-onset dystonia. RARb functions as a transcription factor that is activated upon binding to retinoic acid (RA). Transfection studies indicate that these de novo mutations confer a gain-of-function (GOF) effect. Movement disorders such as dystonia are typically explained by some dysfunction of the striatum. Interestingly, loss of RARb function in mice induces motor impairment and disrupts the prenatal development and post-natal survival of subsets of striatal neurons. We hypothesize that GOF mutations in RARb cause dystonia by increasing RA signaling in the striatum. Alternatively, these mutations could paradoxically reduce RA signaling by affecting retinoid metabolism through feedback loops. We have used Crispr-Cas9 technology to generate mice carrying one of the GOF mutations identified in patients. These RarbR394C/+ mice show a motor behavior that is reminiscent of that of other mouse models of dystonia. We propose to characterize the development and post-natal integrity of the striatum in these mice by marker analyses (WP1). We will dissect the transcriptional and molecular mechanisms by which this mutation affects neural development or function in these mice (WP2) and in human iPSC-derived neural stem cells (NSCs) and neurons from patients carrying the p.R394C mutation (WP3).

The experience of feelings evoked by negative emotional cues like fear or pain displayed in the faces of others is a prerequisite for social functioning and the inhibition of aggressive and antisocial behavior. On a neuronal level there is accumulating evidence that adolescents with conduct disorder (CD), in particular those with high callous-unemotional (CU) traits, are characterized by reduced responsiveness in brain areas important for processing facial cues [1,2]. However, deficient emotion processing is not only observed in CD, but also in other childhood disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Consequently, deficient emotion processing may be a transdiagnostic symptom. However, the neuronal underpinnings that constitute the distinct mechanisms observed in both groups of adolescents remain subject to investigations. Importantly, projects have rarely directly compared individuals of both disorders within the same study, which is consequently hindering a direct conclusion on the specificity of findings. Furthermore, confounding factors that have been discussed to interfere with successful emotion processing and that may be a characteristic for one or even both disorders, above all the impact of attention to facial expressions, have not been sufficiently controlled.

"Zeller, Rolf","Zuniga, Aimée",Departement Biomedizin / Developmental Genetics (Zeller/Zuniga),Integrative analysis of gene regulatory networks with essential functions in limb bud development,2019,"During vertebrate embryonic development, organ and tissue morphogenesis are orchestrated by interactions of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and signaling systems that regulate the proliferation, survival, specification and differentiation of progenitor cell populations. Vertebrate limb bud organogenesis provides an excellent model to study the interactions that coordinate patterning and proliferative expansion of limb bud mesenchymal progenitors (LMPs) with their commitment to the chondrogenic lineage, which will give rise to the limb skeletal elements. One major asset of the limb bud model is that alterations of patterning and/or outgrowth manifest themselves in easily scorable skeletal phenotypes that correlate in general well with the underlying molecular alterations. Therefore, we use mouse limb buds to address questions of fundamental relevance to organogenesis. In particular, we study the GRNs and signaling systems that coordinately control limb bud development by combining genome editing, genetics and experimental embryology with transcriptional profiling, genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses (ChIP-seq) and protein biochemistry. The first part of our research aims to comprehensively analyse the GRNs regulated by key transcription factors during the onset of limb bud development. These GRNs set-up the initial antero-posterior and proximo-distal polarities and restrict SHH to the posterior mesenchyme. This are the main aims: 1. TBX3 interactions with HAND2 in pre-patterning the early limb bud mesenchyme. We will analyse the TBX3 specific and shared HAND2/TBX3 transcriptional targets and GRNs in early mouse limb buds. One main focus will be the analysis of HAND2/TBX3 interactions establishing the posterior Gli3 expression boundary that hallmarks the initial AP polarisation of the limb bud mesenchyme. 2. Direct regulation of Hand2 expression by PBX1/2 and analysis of the target genes co-regulated by PBX and HAND2 in early limb buds. We will analyse the PBX1/2 interacting CRMs in the Hand2 cis-regulatory landscape to gain insight into their functions in the spatial-temporal regulation of Hand2 expression. In addition, we will identify the transcriptional targets and GRNs co-regulated by PBX and HAND2 and analyse the function of key targets in the onset of limb bud development.3. Toward a comprehensive understanding of the molecular interactions and regulatory circuits that govern limb bud pre-patterning. We will determine if HAND2 forms complexes with TBX3, PBX1/2 and/or transcriptional regulators in early limb buds. In addition, we will use simulations of the HAND2, TBX3 and/or PBX controlled GRNs to gain insights into the underlying regulatory logic, which should inform further analysis.The second part of our research aims to gain functional insights into the self-regulatory signaling system defined by the SHH/GREM1/AER-FGF feedback loop. The BMP antagonist Grem1 is a key node in this system that controls distal progression of limb bud outgrowth. Our ongoing analysis has provided evidence for the underlying robustness of this signaling system. Therefore, we aim to uncover the molecular basis and regulatory logic underlying the phenotypic robustness of the signaling system.4. Probing the robustness of the self-regulatory limb bud signaling system. We have generated several Grem1 alleles with reduced expression levels, which provides an unique opportunity to gain insight into the potential robustness of the signaling systems controlling limb skeletal development. We will profile the limb bud transcriptome of Grem1 alleles with stable (=robust) and variable (=labile) pentadactyly and loss of specific digits. The transcriptional signatures will identify genes/pathways for further analysis of their potential involvement in providing the signaling system with robustness.5. Functions of BMP antagonist SMOC1 in the limb bud signaling system. We have identified Smoc1 as an additional BMP antagonist in the signaling system. Therefore, we will assess the requirement of Smoc1 for the signaling interactions that control limb bud organogenesis and assess its role in robustness by compensating reduced Grem1 levels up to a certain threshold.The proposed research takes a holistic approach and should provide fundamental insights into the transcriptional and signaling interactions that ensure robust and stereotypic development of vertebrate limbs, but still permitted tinkering with these interactions during evolutionary diversification.

However, there were gaps within the scientific literature and issues that were clearly in need of a reassessment, next to others left unexplored. Thus, my PhD project 'Re-exploring the Queens' Valley: Archaeological, Social, and Archival Research' aimed at analysing the Queens' Valley through different multi-directional perspectives (archival, social, historical, and archaeological), with the purpose of filling some gaps and offering new interpretations to the use of this necropolis. Among the investigated issues, the analysis of the necropolis landscape played an important role. Thanks to a comparative approach with the Kings' Valley and the Wadi Bariyia necropoleis, along with recourse to the studies of Archaeology of Landscape discipline, it has been possible to offer a new interpretation of the landscape of the Queens' Valley, interpreting it as sacred, ritual, cultural, constructed, conceptualized, and ideational. In turn, the study of the necropolis landscape was closely linked to that of the social identity of the tomb owners of this cemetery, which constituted another relevant research question of the present PhD project. The social identity of the individuals buried within the Queens' Valley during the Ramesside Period (1295-1069 BCE) was well known, but the same could not be said concerning the 18th Dynasty period of use (1550-1295 BC). Through the analysis of archaeological findings from the Queens' Valley (i.e. materials housed at the Museo Egizio of Turin) and a comparative approach that correlates landscape, tomb architecture, and social background of the tomb owners of the Kings' Valley, Wadi Bariyia, and Queens' Valley necropoleis, it has been possible to shed light on the social fabric of the 18th-dynasty Queens' Valley deceased, who were mainly members of the king's family and court individuals. Some of the most relevant and innovative results of the present project come from the analysis of the unpublished documentation of the Italian Archaeological Mission in the Queens' Valley (1903-1905). The examination of such archival documents allowed me to reassess the history of the Italian excavations and the extent of the discoveries. Actually, the archival research highlighted that the Italian team, directed by Ernesto Schiaparelli, investigated many more tombs than previously thought. In addition, by cross-referencing data from the publications of Schiaparelli and his collaborator Francesco Ballerini and information from private letters sent by Ballerini to his family with the unpublished excavation diaries and notes, it was possible to retrace the chronological sequence of the discoveries of the 1903 mission. Moreover, a new, up-to-date, and complete picture of the situation concerning the discoveries that occurred during the 1904 mission has been elaborated. Some of the tombs investigated by the Italian Egyptologists, could not be identified and this aspect seems to suggest that such tombs might still lie under debris, waiting for new archaeological investigations. This PhD research also addressed archaeological materials and the re-contextualization of objects found in the Queens' Valley, which are currently housed at the Museo Egizio of Turin. Several findings without find-spot (which are labelled as 'dispersed materials') have been re-contextualized; moreover, it has been possible to correct the find-spot of other findings that were provided with a (wrong) find-spot and to re-discover, within the collection, objects that had been 'forgotten' among the museum materials. By gathering all the data drawn from the cataloguing of the tombs, archival research, archaeological investigation, and object re-contextualization, an up-to-date history of the Queens' Valley has been reconstructed, focusing on the following stages: the first use of the tombs (18th Dynasty and Ramesside Period), the tomb robberies (late Ramesside Period), the tomb reuse (Third Intermediate, Late, and Roman Periods, i.e., from 1069 BC to 395 AD), and the profanation of the tombs perpetuated by the Copts (starting from the end of the 4th century AD circa). The catalogue of the tombs (which is included in volume II of the dissertation) is an important collection of data and functions as a supporting tool for the reader. Such data, along with the information collected in the course of this research, constitute an important aspect in the framework of the whole work. Finally, the study of phenomena and theoretical issues has been another constant objective, such as the gendered conceptualization of the necropolis and the invention of a new tradition in the 19th Dynasty, the idealization of the necropolis landscape, the social interface of the New Kingdom burial ground, and the places of performance of the funerary and memorial cults for the Queens' valley tomb owners.    ","Queens' Valley, New Kingdom, Landscape, Social Identity, Archival Research, Museum Objects",external_funding,Completed,4508015,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,471,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Consequently, skeletal muscle wasting has far-reaching consequences, being associated with heart and kidney failure, as well as cancer. Muscle wasting is also a hallmark of many neuromuscular diseases that occur with low frequency in human populations. As the average human life span continues to increase, the age-related loss of muscle mass and function, called sarcopenia, has become an important socio-economic challenge of civilized countries. Sarcopenia is the main cause of frailty, which leads to high frequency of falls in the elderly. In the past three years, we have set up a collaborative project, supported by a Sinergia grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation, aiming to identify the molecular pathways that are involved in the development of sarcopenia. We found out that rapamycin is not a clear calorie restriction mimetic, as some have expected. These unique and promising results prompt the question of whether combining rapamycin treatment with calorie restriction could further improve the muscle and organism functionality at advanced age. The aim of this one-year project is to answer this exciting question. The study will shed new light on the mechanisms of age-related muscle wasting and will enable identification of more appropriate drugable target for the treatment of sarcopenia  ","sarcopenia, caloric restriction, calorie restriction, rapamycin",external_funding,Completed,4508262,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,475,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Post-infectious cough is defined as lasting 3 to 8 weeks after an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). It can be very bothersome, disabling in daily activities with substantial impact on physical and psychosocial health, leading to impaired quality of life (QoL). Recommendations for the management of post-infectious cough in primary care are scarce and incoherent. To provide a wide overview of treatment options for patients with post-infectious cough, we conducted and recently published a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials (RCTs) assessing the patient-relevant benefits and potential harms of available treatments. Only six eligible RCTs assessing different treatment regimens (i.e. inhaled fluticasone propionate, inhaled budesonide, salbutamol plus ipratropium-bromide, montelukast, nociception-opioid-1-receptor agonist, codeine, and gelatine) were identified. None of these RCTs found clear patient-relevant benefits and most had an unclear or high risk of bias.Post-infectious cough is thought to be mediated by inflammatory processes that are also present in exacerbations of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD). There is strong evidence that oral corticosteroids for 5 days provide patient-relevant benefit without relevant harm for these conditions. Our systematic search identified no RCTs evaluating oral corticosteroids for post-infectious cough. Thus, a high quality RCT assessing the benefits and harms of orally administered corticosteroids for post-infectious cough is needed.Aim: To assess whether a 5-day treatment with oral corticosteroids provides patient-relevant benefits by improving the cough-related QoL and reducing the duration and intensity of post-infectious cough in adult primary care patients.Methods: The proposed study is a multicentre, 1:1 randomised, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, superiority trial with blinded patients, general practitioners (GP), and outcome assessors in a primary health care setting. We plan to include 204 patients aged 18 or older seeing their GP for a cough lasting 3 to 8 weeks following an URTI. Any concurrent disease possibly explaining the symptoms, such as pneumonia, asthma, COPD, gastroesophageal reflux disease, allergic rhinitis, or cancer will be ruled out before trial inclusion. Patients will receive oral corticosteroid treatment (equivalent of 40 mg prednisone once daily) for 5 days or placebo for 5 days.The primary outcome is cough-related QoL assessed by the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) score 14 days after randomisation. Secondary outcomes are i) cough-related QoL (at day 7, 28, and 3 months), ii) cough-related QoL sub-domains physical, psychological, and social, iii) overall cessation of cough, iv) re-consultations at GP and/or hospitalisations, v) total adverse events (AE), and vi) serious adverse events (SAE). All outcomes will be assessed through follow-up phone calls by study nurses 7, 14, 28 days, and 3 months after randomisation. Clinical follow-up visits with the GP are at the discretion of the patient and the GP.Assumptions for sample size estimation are informed by our systematic review. 204 patients are required to detect a statistically significant minimal clinically important difference of 1.3 of the LCQ score at 14 days (primary outcome; power 80%, two-sided significance level 5%, drop-out-rate 10%). Primary analysis will be done with ANCOVA (analysis of covariance) according to the intention to treat principle. Baseline LCQ scores, duration of cough, age, sex, and smoking status will be covariates.Importance: This will be the first RCT investigating whether oral corticosteroids are beneficial and safe in patients with post-infectious cough, which would have a substantial impact on the well-being and management of these patients in Switzerland and beyond.",NA,external_funding,Active,4507156,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,478,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

They represent clonal disorders of the hematopoietic stem cell with an inherent tendency towards leukemic transformation. MPN are subdivided into three disease entities: polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). Somatic gain of function mutations in the genes JAK2, CALR, or MPL can be detected in blood cells of close to 90% of MPN patients. These gene mutations are known to act as drivers that can cause MPN phenotypes in patients and mouse models. Disease manifestation and prognosis is in part influenced by additional somatic mutation that synergize with the driver mutations, but alone do not cause disease. These additional mutations most frequently occur in genes encoding epigenetic regulators, such as TET2, DNMT3a or EZH2.Much focus is currently invested into studying disease progression and malignant transformation. However, at late stages most cancers are no longer curable. The discovery of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) that can be detected in a substantial proportion of healthy individuals with increasing age led to a major change of paradigm for understanding the pathogenesis of MPN, since mutations in JAK2, in particular JAK2-V617F, are among the most frequently found gene alterations in CHIP. The frequency of JAK2-V617F mutation in the normal population by far exceeds the incidence on MPN. This indicates that the acquisition of the JAK2-V617F mutation is not the rate limiting step, but rather there are factors that limit the expansion of the mutated HSCs. This research proposal focuses on identifying and understanding the early steps in disease initiation in MPN. The proposed experiments will address the following specific aims:1. To identify factors determining the early steps in MPN disease initiation: we will study the effects inflammation and of the immune surveillance in suppressing or promoting the early expansion of the mutant MPN HSCs and the role of modifier gene mutations that are frequently observed together with JAK2-V617F in patients with MPN. We will identify inherited predisposing gene mutations that favor MPN disease initiation.2. To study the mechanism of action of IFNa, currently the most effective drug in inducing remissions, on MPN stem cells and understand factors that determine the responsiveness of HSCs to IFNa.3. To examine genotype-phenotype correlations in MPN and define factors that determine ET versus PV phenotypes in MPN with mutated JAK2.Elucidating the underlying early events responsible for MPN disease initiation will be important to designing strategies for intervention. We expect that diagnosis of pre-clinical cones carrying driver gene mutations will become more frequent as the methodologies for sensitive detection of somatic mutation become commonplace. Questions whether to treat individuals with CHIP (e.g. with IFNa) or whether to inhibit inflammation will need to be answered. By advancing our understanding of the underlying early events in the initiation of MPN from mutant clones will likely lead to new targets for therapeutic intervention.

Our project will be advanced through the following specific aims: Aim 1. Lineage tracing with single-cell transcriptomics in retina organoids: We will develop an inducible cell barcoding system to trace cell lineages at different time points during retina organoid development. We will use this method to label individual retinal progenitor cells, trace their output and lineage trees with high-throughput scRNA-seq, and quantify lineage transition probabilities between cell types. Aim 2: High-throughput reconstructions of retinal malformations: Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) is a class of retinopathies that lead to disrupted photoreceptor function and can result in blindness at birth. We will use CRISPR/Cas9 editing to generate isogenic iPSC lines that contain genetic mutations for various LCA subtypes. We will generate retinal organoids from these iPSC lines and use single-cell transcriptomics and imaging to identify perturbed cell states. Aim 3: Gene targeting for cell-type specific corrective therapy: We will use cell subtype-specific viral vectors to deliver correct versions of mutated genes, or directly correct mutated genes using targeted editing, in retina organoids derived from patients with LCA. We will analyze the effects of corrective therapy using lineage-coupled and spatially resolved whole organoid reconstructions.

"Rüegg, Markus A.",NA,Departement Biozentrum / Pharmacology/Neurobiology (Rüegg),The role of mTORC1 in muscle proteostasis,2019,"Skeletal muscle accounts for up to 50% of the entire body weight in humans. It isessential for locomotion and breathing and it affects whole-body metabolism.Preservation of muscle mass is thus critical to maintain body function and health.Current views indicate that muscle mass is controlled by the tight balance betweenprotein synthesis and protein degradation, called proteostasis. Perturbation of thisbalance by extrinsic factors, as for example seen in cachexia (i.e., muscle loss as asecondary consequence of e.g. cancer, AIDS, or cardiac and kidney disease) or insarcopenia (i.e., loss of muscle mass and function as a consequence of aging), is amain cause of loss of life quality and increased mortality. Thus, a better molecularunderstanding of muscle proteostasis is of fundamental importance to developpossible treatment strategies to counteract the above diseases.Proteostasis is thought to be controlled (1) by the mammalian (or mechanistic) targetof rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) by regulating protein synthesis (Laplante andSabatini, 2012) and (2) by forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factors by regulatingexpression of the proteins involved in protein degradation (Milan et al., 2015; Zhao etal., 2007). Thus, inhibition of mTORC1 and/or activation of FoxO would cause muscleloss (atrophy), whereas activation of mTORC1 and/or inhibition of FoxO would resultin muscle gain (hypertrophy). Consistent with this notion, genetic inactivation ofmTORC1 by muscle-specific depletion of the mTORC1-essential component raptorcauses muscle atrophy (Bentzinger et al., 2008). However and in striking contrast tothe expected outcome of muscle gain, sustained activation of mTORC1 in muscle byknockout of its upstream inhibitor Tsc1 (TSCmKO mice) also results in atrophy, severemyopathy and early death (Bentzinger et al., 2013; Castets et al., 2013). Thisphenotype is observed despite the marked increase in protein synthesis. Hence, themechanisms involved in muscle atrophy in TSCmKO mice remains unresolved.Marco Kaiser investigated the mechanisms that may underlie this phenotype duringhis Ph.D. thesis. In particular, he investigated the role of the most important proteindegradation pathway of cells, which is the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Hiswork has shown that sustained activation of mTORC1 in muscles of TSCmKO miceindeed leads to a significant increase in the expression of all the proteasomal subunitsand increased UPS activity. Marco also observed an increase in the activity of theproteasome in lysates of TSCmKO muscles using an in vitro assay. Interestingly, thesame increase in proteasome activity was observed in ""inducible-TSCmKO""(iTSCmKO) mice upon acute muscle-specific deletion of Tsc1 for 3 weeks. Thisincrease in proteasome activity was, at least in part, reversed by short-term treatmentof the TSCmKO mice with the mTORC1-inhibitor rapamycin. Marco also discoveredthat increased UPS activity was accompanied by a concomitant increase of thetranscription factor ""nuclear factor, erythroid-derived 2,-like 1"" (Nfe2l1, also calledNrf1). Moreover, he found evidence that Nrf1 may regulate the UPS in TSCmKO mice.We now aim to establish that this increase in UPS activity is the mechanism thatcauses muscle atrophy in TSCmKO mice and to test the functional role of Nrf1 in theregulation of the UPS. To do this, we will perturb the function of the UPS by bortezomib(BTZ) and by knocking down Nrf1 by shRNA in skeletal muscle in vivo. We hope thatthese experiments will firmly establish that mTORC1 activation is the main driver ofprotein degradation in skeletal muscle and that Nrf1 is the main regulator of thispathway.

Given the global aging of the population, developing interventions that preserve health in old age and delay the onset of age-related diseases is of utmost relevance. However, developing new strategies to delay aging is a risky, time consuming, and expensive endeavor. The target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) signaling pathway drives organismal aging and its inhibition is a leading candidate for targeting aging. However, long term clinical use of currently available TORC1 inhibitors is limited due to undesirable off-target effects such as hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance. Thus, the ability to selectively inhibit TORC1 uncovers a high therapeutic potential for age-related diseases. We aim to explore a novel mode of TORC1 inhibition for anti-aging applications.

While there is still no cure for AD, there are several prescription drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat its symptoms.

The (sub)polar Atlantic Ocean exerts important controls on the global ocean circulation, the distribution of nutrients in the ocean, and the meridional heat transport. Primary productivity (PP) is an important component of the ocean's biological carbon pump, controlling the partitioning of CO2 between the ocean and the atmosphere. The Greenland ice sheet (GIS) has been melting at unprecedented rates as a consequence of global warming, yet the potential impacts of ice melting on the nutrient availability and biological productivity of Greenland's marine ecosystem are still unclear, because physical and chemical effects are multifaceted, and can either operate in tandem or oppose each other. For example the release of meltwater at depth from marine-terminating glaciers can induce nutrient upwelling and fuel summertime phytoplankton blooms. In contrast, stratification induced by release of meltwater at the ocean surface can impede vertical nutrient supply, limiting primary productivity. Similarly, associated feedbacks and changes related to the air-sea exchange of greenhouse and aerosol-forming gases (CO2, N2O, DMS) are poorly understood. The main objective of GreenMelt is to investigate the links between meltwater- associated nutrient flux to coastal- and open ocean ecosystems and related consequences for net primary and export production (NPP/EP) and the air-sea fluxes of climate-relevant gases, in the Arctic Ocean around Greenland. Two key nutrients, iron (Fe) and nitrogen (N), that are crucial for phytoplankton growth, will be the prime focus of investigations. Within four interconnected workpackages, which make use of a truly synergetic high-resolution sampling approach during the GLACE expedition, we aim at (i) quantifying the contribution of meltwater to micro- and macro- nutrient inventories in the coastal- and open-ocean waters around Greenland constraining the main lithogenic sources of nutrients, specifically, Si, N, P and Fe using stable Si, Fe, Zn and radiogenic Nd isotopes. Moreover, we will (ii) assess the consequences of melt-driven changes in nutrient availability and sea-ice loss on the primary and export production and CO2 exchange, as well as the impact of sea-ice melt on pelagic ecosystem diversity, phenology, and productivity. In this context we will also study spatial changes in the emission of PP-associated dimethylsulfide (DMS). Furthermore, we propose to iii) investigate the impacts of sea-ice melting on the contribution of N2 fixation to the net community production. We will address whether iv) the marine environment around Greenland is a source of N2O, and elucidate what the main N2O producing pathway is. The synergistic, multidisciplinary approach (combining PP and N turnover rate measurements, community characterization and metagenomic analyses, trace metal and stable isotope measurements, as well as trace gas and organic particle observations), with integration of field measurements and laboratory experiments, and using an unprecedented array of instruments connected to the underway water supply, will allow us to elucidate the multifaceted impacts sea-ice melting is imposing on the productivity and biogeochemistry in polar marine environments. Results from the proposed research program will have important implications for understanding how predicted future climate change and continued sea ice retreat will ultimately affect arctic marine ecosystems and biologically-driven green house gas exchange between polar seas and the atmosphere, with important feedbacks on the global climate.","Iron, nitrate, N2 fixation, net community production, pCO2, N2O, DMS, photophysiology, community characterization, N isotope biogeochemistry, upwelling, meltwater flux",external_funding,Active,4492457,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,485,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

"De Roo, Jonathan; Helmy, Hala",NA,Departement Chemie / Nanomaterials (De Roo),Development of Nanocrystals as Artificial Mitochondria in Molecular Factories,2019,"Energy conversion systems are a prerequisite to fuel top-down fabricated molecular factories. Such systems are the power plants of the factory and are thus equivalent to mitochondria in cells. Systems with colloidal nanocrystals at their hearth are very promising in this regard. Artificial photosynthesis, where light is converted in chemical energy, is catalysed by semiconducting nanocrystals. On the other hand, plasmonic nanocrystals can directly convert light into heat, thereby very locally raising the temperature. Such a mechanism is intensely researched for photodynamic therapy of cancer or to catalyse chemical reactions. Current challenges in photodynamic therapy include delivery of the particles to the tumour, a hurdle that is ascribed to poorly controlled surface chemistry. To incorporate nanocrystal based energy conversion systems in complex molecular factories, the toxicity and cost of the currently used semiconductor nanocrystals (cadmium or lead based) or plasmonic nanocrystals (noble metal based) must be tackled and the nanocrystals must be immobilized in the reaction compartments of the solid state platform developed in WP1 of the NCCR Molecular Systems Engineering. The latter requires a double surface functionalization, connecting the surface of both the nanocrystals and the reaction compartment. A limitation in studying the surface functionalization of the reactor compartments, is the challenging characterization of the solid state. However, nanocrystals of a few nanometer in diameter are ideally suited as model systems to study the interaction of organic molecules with metal, oxide or nitride surfaces through solution NMR techniques. The PI has already demonstrated this for carboxylic acid, phosphonic acid and diphosphoric acids ligands on CdSe, HfO2 and CsPbBr3 surfaces. Here, we introduce novel plasmonic nanocrystals based on nontoxic and earth abundant titanium nitride (TiN). TiN is often cited as a sustainable replacement for gold, with the additional advantage of displaying activity in the near infra-red. This opens up opportunities for photodynamic therapy of cancer cells using IR light, with deeper penetration in tissue. Furthermore, we functionalize oxide and nitride nanocrystals with tailor-made ligands that have a high binding affinity and tunable functionality. Such ligands facilitate targeted delivery for photodynamic therapy and also make it possible to couple nanocrystals to the reactor compartments.",NA,external_funding,Active,4516110,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,487,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Plant reproduction of the alpine zone: disentangling ecological drivers of trait evolution,2019,"How do plants adapt during major ecological transitions, such as evolutionary shifts between biomes? In particular, should we expect different plant species to adapt in similar ways to the same ecological challenges? And what specific aspects of ecological transitions drive phenotypic evolution? These are the motivating questions of the four-year project that addresses drivers of reproductive trait evolution in genera that radiated across elevational belts in multiple mountain systems. By reconstructing evolutionary trees (phylogenies) of these species, the project will link shifts in climatic niches to the evolution of plant traits, in particular flowers and inflorescences. By including tropical alpine, temperate alpine, and lowland species, we can reveal what specific aspects of climatic niches drive the evolution of plant form and plant reproduction. Multiple genera allow for addressing the extent to which species from different evolutionary backgrounds evolve similarly (convergently) along the same environmental gradients, helping us to understand whether studies of adaptation on few species can be generalized. That alpine species look different from lowland species is known to every Swiss person. Surprisingly, we still don't understand what specific aspects of high elevation ecosystems drive this striking trend in trait evolution. One problem in studying this problem is that the processes of adaptation are typically very slow, so experiments (e.g. transplant experiments or climatic modifications) may yield only limited information related to plasticity and evolution from standing genetic variation, ignoring trait evolution in deep evolutionary time.

Hence, its function is critical for the successful establishment and maintenance of the immune system's capacity to distinguish between vital self and injurious non-self. This competence is primarily instructed by thymic epithelial cells (TECs). However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms controlling thymus formation, homeostatic maintenance and function are at present only incompletely defined. Spontaneously occurring, monogenic loss and gain of function mutations in man have been highly informative in defining the mechanisms that establish and maintain the physiology of complex organ systems. Selecting two of these ""experiments of nature"" with relevance to thymus biology, we anticipate to gain unprecedented insight not only into the pathomechanisms of these selected primary immunodeficiencies but, equally importantly, advance our understanding of the genetic, epigenetic and biochemical mechanisms that underpin normal thymus biology. Specifically, this research proposal seeks (i) to characterize the mechanism by which naturally occurring mutations of the transcription factor FOXN1 gain a dominant negative function and consequently impair normal thymus biology (Specific Aim 1); (ii) to elucidate the role of Lin28A expression regulating TEC growth, metabolism and function (Specific Aim 2); and (iii) to reveal the role of adenylate kinase 2 (AK2) in maintaining a normal cell energy level and regular metabolic functions in TEC (Specific Aim 3).Working Hypothesis The proposed research is based on the testable hypotheses that TEC development and function are severely compromised (i) by mutations in the transcriptional activation domain of FOXN1, consequently disrupting the interaction with co-factors required for the correct DNA, (ii) the disruption of the Lin28A/let-7 axis; and (iii) by the disruption of adequate, AK2-controlled energy homeostasis.Specific Aims#1: To define the structure::function relationships of wild type and dominant negative forms of FOXN1.#2: To establish a role for the Lin28A/let-7 miRNA feedback axis in TEC biology.#3: To delineate the role of adenylate kinase 2 in TEC development and function. Experimental Design and MethodsWe will address these specific aims using mouse gene editing combined with state of the art molecular biology, cell biology, imaging and bioinformatic analysis. In particular, we have generated new mouse models to specifically probe the function of the three interrelated gene products, FOXN1, LIN28 and AK2, in TECs at distinct developmental stages. The chosen design of TEC-specific targeting of Lin28 and Ak2 avoids early embryonic lethality and thus allows the detailed investigation of their impact on TEC differentiation and function at distinct developmental stages, ranging from mid-gestation embryogenesis to senescence. Cytometry-based deep phenotyping, transcriptomic analyses at both population level and single cell resolution, and high-parameter single cell spatial imaging are tools to be employed to gain a better understanding of the consequences of the experimentally introduced genetic perturbations. Expected Value of the Proposed ProjectThe thymus plays a vital role in generating a repertoire of functionally competent T cells and thus provides a unique function that relies on molecular mechanisms astonishingly unique from that of other epithelial organs. The proposed work focuses on two human primary immunodeficiencies that severely affect TEC function. Although their causative gene mutations have been identified, the precise cellular and molecular mechanism underpinning these pathologies remain to be defined. The proposed research will therefore provide not only novel insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms that prompt this loss of TEC function but will also inform on the genetic control of regular TEC development and function.

JAK2 and FLT3 inhibitors show suboptimal efficacy and loss of response. Thus, insight into resistance mechanisms is key to inform sustainable therapies. I will study resistance focusing on JAK2 and FLT3 inhibition in MPN and AML. Resistance after initial response (""acquired resistance"") and suboptimal initial response (""intrinsic resistance"") will be addressed along with novel therapeutic strategies.MPN are chronic leukemias with excess of mature myeloid cells, transformation to AML and propensity to thromboses, characterized by constitutively activated JAK2 signaling. JAK2 activates STAT3/5, PI3K/AKT and the MAPK pathway with MEK and ERK kinases. JAK2 inhibitors blocking the active kinase (type I inhibition) loose effect in 50% of patients. Resistance mutations have been detected in cell lines but not in patients. We have shown resistance via JAK family heterodimer formation in MPN cells, but insight into mechanisms in patients is scarce. Given these limitations, I characterized the novel type II JAK2 inhibition blocking inactive JAK2 with high efficacy. Little is known whether type II JAK inhibition also evokes acquired resistance. In addition, JAK2 inhibition cannot suppress MAPK activation in MPN in vivo, as compensatory MAPK activation via PDGFRa signaling mediates intrinsic resistance to JAK2 inhibition. Combined JAK2/MEK inhibition showed superior effects, but knowlege is scarce about the significance of other MAPK pathway components as ERK and whether MAPK activation may contribute to resistance in other myeloid leukemias as FLT3-mutant AML. In AM with acute expansion of blasts, mutations in FLT3 are most frequent. FLT3 activates MAPK and PI3K signaling as well as STAT5 and FLT3 inhibitors have limited activity. As we observe superior effects of combined FLT3/MEK inhibtion in FLT3-mutant AML cells, we hypothesize MAPK activation could contribute to FLT3 inhibitor resistance. I will characterize intrinsic and acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibition in these myeloid leukemias and respective therapeutic approaches.Specific research aims: 1. We will study intrinsic resistance in MPN/AML focusing on MAPK activation as mediator and therapeutic target. We will address the significance of targeting ERK1/2 to overcome resistance in MPN with genetic and pharmacologic approaches and study the role of MAPK activation for FLT3 inhibitor resistance in AML.2. We will study acquired resistance with a focus on type I and II JAK2 inhibitors in MPN. We aim to understand whether and how the novel type II JAK inhibition evokes resistance and how it can be abrogated. We will study incidence, dynamics and mechanism of resistance to type I JAK inhibitors in MPN patients.3. As a further perspective, we will study thrombosis formation in MPN focusing on the role of platelet activation and turnover in the setting of activated JAK2 and MAPK signaling, resistance and interventions.Hypotheses: We expect combined JAK/ERK inhibition to increase therapeutic efficacy in MPN given ERK's essential role for hematopoiesis and distal position, and we anticipate a role of compensatory MAPK activation in FLT3-inhibitor resistance (Aim 1). For acquired resistance to JAK2 inhibitors, we expect adaptive rather than genetic processes given the observed reversibility (Aim 2). In addition, we hypothesize platelet activation in the setting of JAK2 and MAPK activation to promote thromboses in MPN (Aim 3).Relevance: These studies will enhance our insight into the biology and therapeutic targeting of intrinsic and acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibition and innovatively relate to new aspects of thrombosis formation in these myeloid malignancies.",JAK2; Acute myeloid leukemia; Resistance; FLT3 ; Tyrosine kinase inhibition; Myeloid malignancies; Myeloproliferative neoplasms,external_funding,Active,4487788,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,490,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

SHEDS is an online survey designed and implemented by researchers from SCCER CREST. In phase I, an exploratory study compares patterns of differences in energy demand and consumption behaviour between households living in Zurich city with other parts of Switzerland, namely 1) Households in Zürich canton (KZH), excluding SZH and Winterthur; 2) Households in the 8 major Swiss cities other than SZH namely, Geneva, Lausanne, Bern, Basel, Luzern, Winterthur, Biel/Bienne, and St. Gallen; and 3) Households from the rest of Switzerland, i.e. all excluding groups 1-3 above. The analysis is based on group mean comparisons and generic OLS regressions applied to a panel data set extracted from four waves of the SHEDS from 2016 to 2019, including around 1'200 households in Zurich City and in total about 22'000 observations across the German and French-speaking parts of Switzerland. The objective is to analyse a wide scope of variables characterizing household demand in three main energy fields (electricity, mobility and heating) as well as a selection of related psychological factors such as intentions and norms. Phase II builds on the exploratory findings of Phase I. The main objective of Phase II is to identify meaningful differences that characterize the energy demand of households in Zurich compared to other cities/cantons. The econometric methods allow to: 1) decompose potential differences according to four groups of determinants thus linking them to various underlying mechanisms, and 2) identify the distribution of these differences across a selection of relevant population segments based on a selection of moderating factors. The project's focus is on two primary energy domains namely, electricity and private mobility. In order to provide an adequate comparative inference, it is required that the Zurich subsamples (treatment groups) are ""matched"" and compared with their comparable counterparts (control groups) in the rest of Switzerland. Therefore, in Phase II, we conduct a Propensity Score Matching (PSM) approach to identify the optimal matching groups that can be compared with each household in Zurich.

The multikinase inhibitor sorafenib is the only approved drug to treat HCC and on average enhances survival by three months. Thus, the efficacy of current HCC treatment options is very limited. Studies in the context of our ERC-Synergy grant revealed that sorafenib resistance correlates with upregulation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling. The central role of mTORC1 in conferring therapy resistance suggests that effective therapy against HCC may require combination of a primary inhibitor (e.g., sorafenib) and an mTORC1 inhibitor. The mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin and its derivatives (rapalogs) are approved for a few advanced cancers, but not for HCC. Their clinical applicability is limited by their effectiveness and safety. Rapalogs fail to completely inhibit mTORC1 as they have little effect on inhibiting phosphorylation of 4E-BP, one of the two main targets of mTORC1. Moreover, rapamycin and rapalogs also inhibit mTORC2 when chronically administered, leading to undesirable effects such as hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance. We have established a biophysical assay to identify selective mTORC1 inhibitors with a novel, rapalogunrelated, mechanism of action. We predict these inhibitors to be more selective, more effective, and potentially safer than mTORC1 inhibitors currently used in the clinic.

Upon activation with various stimuli, neutrophils release DNA and chromatin material into the extracellular space, a process coined neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation. Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 can recognize double stranded (ds)DNA and initiate the characteristic type I interferon (IFN) signature that has been implicated in the breakdown of peripheral tolerance and generation of autoreactive T- and B-cells. Recent data suggests that subjects with SLE are characterized by impaired NET degradation, disseminating the availability of extracellular DNA as a proinflammatory stimulus to the innate immune system. NETs may also contain mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), a dsDNA molecule which is phylogenetically evolved from bacteria and rich in hypomethylated CpG sequences, thus especially suited to trigger TLR9 signaling and disease flares. Working Hypothesis: SLE and AAV patients have increased plasma concentrations of circulating extracellular mtDNA, possibly released by NET formation. Elevated mtDNA concentrations are associated with disease flares. NET formation on the one hand contributes to overt mtDNA release, and on the other hand is modulated by circulating mtDNA or nDNA, as well as by hormones and cytokines.Overall objectives and specific aims: We aim to analyse the extent and nature of circulating extracellular DNA species (mtDNA vs. nuclear DNA) in SLE and AAV and determine if mtDNA plasma concentrations can serve as a marker for diagnosis and disease activity. Furthermore, we aim to determine which factors promote, modulate and inhibit the NETotic release of mtDNA in comparison to nuclear DNA.Experimental methods and design: Using quantitative PCR, we will determine circulating DNA concentrations (mtDNA and nuclear DNA) in centrifuged plasma samples from patients with SLE and AAV and compare them with those of healthy controls and patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Uni- and multivariate statistics will correlate circulating DNA plasma concentrations with disease activity, using known disease activity markers as covariates. In vitro work will examine the triggers and inhibitors of NETosis in AID derived neutrophils and plasma and analyse their presence in patients plasma in comparison with that from healthy controls. Expected value of the proposed project: Manifest mtDNA release is likely to contribute to the pathology of SLE and AAV by feeding back to neutrophil activation and thereby to disease activity and systemic inflammation.

Albeit considerable progress has been done in last years, several problems still claim for solutions. Among them, questions concerning the validity of the Boltzmann Eq.n, as well as its quantum version, are certainly of primary interest both from a physical and mathematical viewpoint. Major open questions deal with the long time derivation of the Boltzmann Eq.n; its validity for long range interactions; the role of boundary conditions; the derivation of the quantum Boltzmann Eq.n from a system of quantum particles. In light of recent mathematical developments, we propose a research agenda to contribute in the aforementioned items:a) Derivation of the Boltzmann Eq.n for long range potentials. Our goal is to deeply understand the onset of instability due to the long tail effects, first of all looking at the linear Boltzmann Eq.n. We believe techniques developed in a work in preparation joint with L. Desvillettes and S. Simonella will be successful ingredients and draw the lines for a long term investigation in the nonlinear case.b) Derivation of the Boltzmann Eq.n with inelastic collisions. When collisions occurring at microscopic scale are inelastic, a loss of energy in the scattering process appears. It can be seen as a boundary effect. We plan to rigorously derive the Boltzmann Eq.n for granular gases, by adapting techniques developed by Gallagher, Saint-Raymond, Texier and Pulvirenti, Saffirio, Simonella. The result would be relevant for applications and provide the first step to understand the role of boundaries in the validity of the Boltzmann Eq.n.c) Derivation of the Landau Eq.n. When the long-range interaction is the Coulomb potential, the Boltzmann collision operator is no longer well defined and has to be replaced by the Landau operator. We are interested in the rigorous derivation of the Landau Eq.n from a Hamiltonian system of interacting particles in the weak-coupling limit. We plan to combine the result obtained by Bobylev, Pulvirenti, Saffirio with the mathematical methods recently developed by Velázquez and Winter, thus providing an equivalent of Lanford's result in the weak-coupling context.d) Evolution of fermionic systems with Coulomb interaction. In light of recent developments obtained by Benedikter, Porta, Saffirio, Schelin, we plan to provide an explicit rate for the semiclassical limit of the Hartree-Fock dynamics towards the Vlasov-Poisson Eq.n. We expect techniques developed here to be useful for point e).e) Derivation of the quantum Boltzmann Eq.n. We plan to perform a weak-coupling scaling in the many-body Schr odinger Eq.n and to obtain the quantum Boltzmann Eq.n in the limit.

"Rapcsak, Balazs",NA,Departement Sprach- und Literaturwissenschaften / Amerikanistik (Schweighauser),Samuel Beckett's Media Art,2019,"Over the past decade critics have increasingly recognized Beckett's significance as a media artist, but the contours of this designation have remained rather vague. Just how innovative and how radical was Samuel Beckett as a media artist? What scientific developments and technological blueprints inspired Beckett's media aesthetic? And how urgently does its increasing technological obsoleteness call for a reassessment of this work that has nevertheless lost none of its power to fascinate scholars, to enthral audiences, and to influence new generations of media artists? The project is driven by the conviction that the coexistence of Beckett's literary production, his output in radio and TV, and his experimentation with machine language, coding, and digitality is an essential characteristic of this work that shouldn't be played down in favour of a compartmentalized analysis of these fields, but that cannot be narrativized into a logical sequence of formal experiments either. Insightful as they are, accounts that trace interart influences within the 'oeuvre', the third approach dominating the critical discourse, have also left this particular question unanswered. A series of case studies will serve to test and nuance the hypothesis that Beckett's work represents, among other things, a uniquely subtle artistic negotiation of three successive technological and cultural paradigms: literary culture and the humanist tradition, analogue media and the age of telecommunications, and cybernetics and digitality. The analyses will explore the array of aesthetic strategies, not least textual operations, that produce entanglements between these three different models of signification. With a special focus on the theatrical scripts, the project aims to reconceptualize the Beckettian 'media play', a term conventionally - and perhaps unreflectingly - reserved for the pieces Beckett wrote for radio, film, television, and video. Somewhat provocatively, then, the project addresses the problem of Beckett's 'media art' in the singular, arguing that its generative tensions cannot be neatly mapped onto its radiophonic, filmic, televisual, literary, and theatrical instantiations. Drawing on genetic criticism (facilitated by the ongoing Beckett Digital Manuscript Project), production history, and the recently published letters, the project also looks at the interaction between this work and a changing media ecology, tracing, to give just one particularly intriguing example, Beckett's ingenuity in manipulating various media channels in order to control the reception of his work.",NA,external_funding,Completed,4508014,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,503,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

As the frequency of latent infections increases with age, it is a major concern for aging societies. The great diversity of the infectious agents, and the multidisciplinary nature of the infectious biology research demand a convergence of various competencies: microbiology, cell biology, animal infection models, immunology etc, emphasizing the need for collaboration between research centres.

P-Rex1/2 specifically, are known to interact with mTOR and PTEN, among others, placing them at the nexus of regulatory pathways for cell metabolism, proliferation and mobility.Despite their central role in cell signaling, very little is known about the interplay between such interactions. No structural information is available for the full-length P-Rex proteins and how different interaction partners affect its structure and function. I will therefore set out to better characterize the emerging properties of the multidomain P-Rex proteins by purifying both P-Rex1/2 and determining their structure using cryo-EM and orthogonal biophysical characterization methods. I then aim to define the interaction between P-Rex proteins and its regulatory partners, PTEN and the mTOR complexes 1 and 2.

Examples include different neurons in the brain, epithelial cells lining the gut, or the cells that produce the bone or cartilage in our skeletons. During embryogenesis, all of these diverse cell types develop from a single progenitor cell - the fertilized egg. Understanding the different molecular mechanisms that orchestrate this diversification can help us re-create a particular cell type in a cell culture dish. Having access to such 'in vitro'-generated cells would then enable their use in tissue repair and replacement strategies in human patients. What are the potential difficulties in achieving these goals? Many cell type specification processes require complex interactions with the surrounding tissue. Hence, only in the context of a developing embryo can these processes be fully understood, making the use of non-human 'model organisms' indispensable. This, however, raises additional questions: how can we minimize the number of experimental animals used in these studies, and how can we ensure that findings in such model organisms also translate to us humans? To address these challenges, here I propose to integrate comparative genomics data to define conserved 'core regulatory switches' that specify a given cell type across species.

Elles sont dès lors internationalisées et concentrent leurs intérêts dans le domaine de l'économie. Les institutions universitaires participent de la progressive émergence de ces nouvelles élites au cours des Trente Glorieuses. Dans cette thèse, je m'appuie sur la sociologie des élites pour investiguer précisément cette phase de préparation à travers le modèle de formation des élites internationales de l'Institut universitaire des hautes études internationales à Genève. Cet institut est créé en 1927 avec le but initial de former du personnel diplomatique à destination des institutions de la Genève internationale de l'entre-deux-guerres.A l'aide de l'approche micro-globale, qui constitue l'un des principaux atouts de ma recherche, j'observe comment ce modèle internationaliste intègre les spécificités locales et nationales.

Thus, it is crucial to investigate physiological and psychological influences of artificial lighting, particularly in the current advent of new technologies for light emitting diodes. The overall aim of this project is to test the facilitating effects of light by manipulating its spectral wavelength composition and illuminance under mental fatigue and sleep restriction conditions. Within this project, I am proposing integrative theoretical models for lighting influence on mental effort. I suggest corresponding models concerning 1) impact through melanopic irradiance - spectral manipulation without perceived changes in color nor illuminace and 2) impact through illuminance when spectral properties remain constant. The models predict how, due to effects on alertness, light should impact experienced task demand and thus invested effort, based on motivational intensity theory. The main dependent variable-effort-is defined as resource mobilization to perform instrumental behavior. Effort will be quantified as changes in beta-adrenergic sympathetic nervous system impact on the heart. This proposal consists of three projects. Project 1 will focus on influence of lighting on mental effort by testing effects of melanopic irradiance and of illuminance. Project 2 will focus on predicted facilitating lighting functions in case of motivational deficits caused by mental fatigue. Finally, Project 3 will test the predictions concerning facilitating lighting effects on motivational deficits due to fatigue, where fatigue will be manipulated in controlled laboratory conditions by means of sleep restriction. Taken together, the planned systematic investigations will help to understand influences of different lighting parameters on motivation and effort investment. Moreover, interior planners, designers, and any of us who uses artificial lighting will benefit by understanding how to more appropriately adjust lighting for certain contexts, for example, for environments of high cognitive demand like in offices or schools.

Previous research has observed certain cognitive characteristics in patients with schizophrenia, such as the tendency to arrive early at decisions without accumulating enough evidence beforehand. This has been called the jumping-to-conclusions bias. In a nutshell, this cognitive bias can be attributed to aberrant decisional and judgment processes in the context of information integration and evidence evaluation. Trait intuition research, which has observed that an intuitive thinking style is positively associated with schizotypal traits and delusional ideation in healthy adults, may raise the question of whether patients with schizophrenia are ""too intuitive"" in situations where enough information exists but is ignored, leading to the jumping-to-conclusions bias. Intuition is thereby defined as an unconscious, experience-based, and action-initiating decision strategy. Depending on the situation, it can lead to either biased or correct decision outcomes. However, the ability to use intuition is indispensable for preferential daily-life decision making in order to stay adaptive. Main aim: The planned study aims to examine the temporal relationship between intuitive judgment and decision making and the jumping-to-conclusions bias in daily life (naturalistic level) and with neuroimaging (neurocognitive level). To address this aim, intuition will be explored from a process perspective, which will make it possible to disentangle underlying neurocognitive mechanisms and circumvent the drawbacks of self-report measures that have been typically used when investigating intuition from a trait perspective. Method: There will be two groups of participants (patients, healthy controls), randomly allocated to one of two conditions (intuition first vs. jumping to conclusions first). To assess the relationship between intuition and the jumping-to-conclusions bias on a neurocognitive level, while being scanned with fMRI, participants will perform a classic intuition task that operationalizes intuition via semantic coherence judgments and a probabilistic reasoning task to assess the jumping-to-conclusions bias. The fMRI sessions will be followed by an ecological momentary assessment of intuitive decision making and the jumping-to-conclusions bias in daily life (naturalistic level). Expected outcomes: The jumping-to-conclusions bias is expected to be higher in the patients than in the control group, replicating previous work. A high use of intuition in daily life is expected to predict the jumping-to-conclusions bias in patients with schizophrenia. Neuronal activation patterns accompanying intuition are assumed to be deficient in the patients compared to the healthy group. Relevance of the planned work: The study has the potential for highly relevant scientific and ultimately also clinical implications. On the scientific level, the results will inform and augment (a) existing neuroscientific models on intuition, and (b) prevailing cognitive models on the formation and maintenance of key symptoms in schizophrenia.

Enzymes that utilize O2 as the terminal electron acceptor catalyze a large number of biological reactions involved in processes of metabolic activity, cellular detoxification, and biosynthesis. Many of these reactions are essential for life, but some of them also contribute to the metabolic and co-metabolic removal of anthropogenic organic contaminants in natural aquatic environments and during wastewater treatment. Abiotic reduction of O2 is important for the biogeochemical cycling of elements, such as iron or other trace metals, as well as the photomineralization of organic compounds in sunlit surface water. Measuring systematic changes in the stable isotopic composition (i.e., isotope fractionation) of dissolved O2 during enzymatic reactions has been shown to enable the identification of underlying O2 reduction mechanisms. Consequently, measuring isotope fractionation of O2 is a promising tool for investigating environmentally relevant redox reactions. However, to ultimately apply this approach to reactions with unknown O2 reduction mechanisms, it is important to systematically extend the current knowledge of reaction-specific 18O-kinetic isotope effects (18O-KIEs), which ultimately determine observable isotope fractionation of enzymatic and abiotic reactions of O2 in aquatic environments.The overall objective of this project is to experimentally determine reaction-specific 18O-KIEs associated with selected enzymatic and abiotic O2 reduction reactions and, in turn, to evaluate the potential of O2 isotope analysis as a tool to study environmental redox reactions. The central part of this project will entail the systematic investigation of well-known enzymatic reactions in laboratory experiments to determine the dependence of O2 consumption-associated 18O-KIEs on the type of enzyme, substrate, and catalyzed reaction. Different O2 reduction reactions will be studied in headspace-free reactors containing an oxidase or oxygenase enzyme, native or non-native substrates, and required cofactors and/or co-substrates. Reaction-specific 18O-KIEs will be determined in replicate experiments, where O2 concentrations will be monitored continuously, and the isotopic composition of dissolved O2 will be measured at different time-points. Comparison of these 18O-KIEs with isotope fractionation of O2 during enzymatic oxidations of anthropogenic contaminants with unknown reaction mechanisms will represent the first step in our efforts to evaluate the suitability of this approach to study O2 reduction mechanisms in anthropogenically impacted ecosystems. Similarly, 18O-KIEs will be studied for photochemical reactions involving O2 , including singlet oxygen and superoxide radical formation. The gas chromatography isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/IRMS) method used for these experiments will be optimized regarding sample size and the O2 extraction procedure at the beginning of the proposed project.It is expected that results from this project will enable the routine use of isotope analysis of O2 to study environmentally relevant redox reactions in laboratory-scale experiments and provide valuable mechanistic insights into specific enzymatic and abiotic redox reactions. The comprehensive set of 18O-KIEs determined in this work will establish benchmarks for various abiotic and microbial O2 consumption processes in the aquatic environment, which can be used in future studies applying isotope analysis of dissolved O2 , or of organic products containing O-atoms derived from O2, in natural systems.",NA,external_funding,Active,4512349,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,513,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"Martin, Barbara Marie",NA,Departement Geschichte / Bereich Osteuropäische Geschichte,Finding Faith in an Atheist Land: Russian Orthodox Intelligentsia and the Late Soviet National-Religious Revival,2019,"The 1960s and 1970s constituted a period of religious revival throughout the West, characterized by the emergence of new types of spirituality and religious movements, which placed a greater emphasis on individual experience and group worship, thus weakening the traditional role of churches. Disenchantment with ideologies and with industrial society fueled a religious revival with decidedly modern characteristics. In the Soviet Union, an atheist land regularly indicted for its infringements of the rights of believers, similar dynamics unfolded, bolstered by the rise of nationalist movements. Despite the attempt to isolate Soviet citizens from global developments, the 1960s were characterized by an opening to the West through foreign radio broadcasts and increased cultural and scientific exchanges. These developments had a marked impact on a predominantly urban intelligentsia, providing a fertile ground for the rise of political, nationalist, and religious dissent. This study examines the Orthodox revival within the Russian intelligentsia, from the early forms of independent worship and opposition to the religious status quo in the 1970s, which were labelled as ""dissent,"" to the development of a mass movement or national and religious revival during the last years of the Soviet Union. Complexifying the predominant narrative of a ""return of the repressed,"" this research posits that the Russian Orthodox revival corresponded to what Anthony Wallace called a process of ""revitalization"" of an erstwhile Russian culture. Following the fragmentation of the Soviet cultural paradigm, violently imposed through partial acculturation for over half a century, a new Russian national and religious identity emerged as a result of heightened contacts with the West, inspired from an earlier Russian culture but redefined on modern terms to fit new needs. While the intelligentsia initiated this process of revitalization and tended towards a model combining religious with liberal- democratic values, I argue that the broadening of the process to the Russian masses during Perestroika caused the marginalization of this liberal model, with a progressive shift towards a new paradigm combining conservative Orthodoxy with nationalism and illiberalism. Interrogating the causes, manifestations, and consequences of this Russian Orthodox revival, this study examines the trajectories of young Orthodox believers and clergy from the intelligentsia, from the 1970s to the early post-Soviet era, with a focus on the two Russian metropoles Moscow and Leningrad (Saint-Petersburg). While in the 1970s and early 1980s, their activities often fell under the label of dissent and triggered repression, by the late 1980s, the same actors were participating of the broader religious revival, and they would continue throughout the post-Soviet years to seek to influence the religious and political life of their country. Based on oral history, memoirs, and the analysis of underground and official publications of these Orthodox groups, this project constitutes the first studyon the Orthodox Revival of the late Soviet era. Breaking with the predominant vision in Soviet-era historiography depicting Orthodox dissent as a resurgence of a repressed religion in reaction to state repression, this research reinserts the Russian Orthodox case within a global context of cultural change and transnational influences, offering a model of analysis possibly replicable for other cases of national and religious revival throughout the late Soviet Union.",NA,external_funding,Active,4512351,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,514,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"Braun, Lesley Nicole",NA,Departement Gesellschaftswissenschaften / Visuelle und politische Ethnologie (Förster),The Travail and Travels of Congolese Transnational Trader Women,2019,"While West African women maintain a long history of trading in the region and abroad, Central African women-specifically in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)- have only recently embedded themselves in international trade circuits. Congo's transnational trader women called femmes commercantes, embark on international buying expeditions to purchase wholesale goods for local resale. Currently, China is a common destination, as it offers affordable products which yield a good profit margin. Strengthened governmental relations between the DRC and China have also contributed to the increased mobility between the two countries. Congo's trader women are at the forefront of creating new social classes, as well as household structures, and are therefore an important social group through which to examine the dynamics and relationship between what is locally called ""informal"" and ""formal"" modes of employment. Approached through ethnographic fieldwork, this research proposes to examine how Congolese women navigate an economic landscape that is premised on social networks and transnational exchanges. More broadly, it seeks to explore how global economic change impacts gender dynamics in the DRC. Transnational trade as mode of labour is considered by the Congolese state to be part of the ""informal economy"". Women increasingly are urged by the state to ""formalize"" their work-a nebulous concept for both the state and its citizens. Despite this pressure, and because of little incentives, transnational trader women continue to operate informally, often selling their imported products within the private space of their homes. Successful women, just like men, must engage with a system of corruption. However, unlike their male counterparts, there are moral implications related to women's mobility. The central theme within this research investigates the relationship between women's work within a labour system defined by its internal corruption, mobility, and morality in an African context where women are participants in the transformation of social class structures. At an empirical level, the project aims to generate case studies of Congolese transnational trader women to address the following questions: - To what extent do new trends of mobility and labor migration impact existing ideals of feminine virtue in the urban context of Kinshasa? - What are the differences between operating within the formal and informal economies? - What does women's involvement within the informal economy reveal about how they perceive the state? The project will be relevant to social scientists, as well as academic partners in Europe and in the DRC and China, interested in the ways in which gender relations and household structures shape and shaped by global economic changes, as well as Congolese women's roles in the emergent mobilities between Africa and China. This project is also conceived of as a network of exchange and cooperation with African and Chinese institutions.","women, Africa, gender, morality, China, Corruption, trade, migration, work",external_funding,Active,4512352,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,515,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

As a consequence, it is widely recognized that humans have negative duties (that is, duties of non-interference and non-maleficence) towards them. In other words, humans should not inflict unnecessary harms upon animals. Less attention, however, has been paid to the question of whether humans have positive duties (that is, duties of assistance) towards animals, and if so, what those duties encompass, whether those duties vary according to the type of animal under consideration, and what should be done if those duties are in conflict with others that we hold. Additionally, it is unclear who bears such duties and responsibilities: is it merely individuals, or are these collective duties all members of a society share? If the latter is the case, do these duties have to be implemented on a political level? Do animals have a claim for having their interests represented on a political level, and should their interests thus be taken into consideration in the process of political decision-making? However, since animals cannot voice their interests themselves in political deliberations (similar to future generations, young children and cognitively disabled individuals), new ways have to be found to represent their interests. Furthermore, the project will explore how such positive duties might be appropriately balanced and prioritized given scarce resources and the pressing existing obligations towards humans, and how these duties can be institutionalized on a political level.",NA,external_funding,Active,4483714,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,516,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

The reason for this is that the gap between therapeutic and toxic concentration is very narrow. This, combined with the fact that there exists high inter-individual variability, has led to the need for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). The goal of TDM is to individualize the dosage to achieve maximum efficacy and at the same time minimize drug toxicity. TDM has obvious clinical benefits for patients and healthcare systems. However, TDM in children is particularly challenging. In addition, traditionally used venipunctures to determine drug concentrations are not well tolerated by children. The goal of this project is to address these challenges by providing a non-invasive and patient-specific solution, whereby drugs requiring TDM in children will be monitored in exhaled breath. We will use a cutting-edge analytical platform (i.e. secondary electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry) available at the University Children's Hospital Basel to detect drugs in breath with unparalleled speed, selectivity and sensitivity. Initially, we will measure simultaneously blood and breath concentrations of drugs routinely monitored in our hospital (e.g. anti-convulsants). We will then use this information as an input to develop pharmacokinetic computational models to predict blood concentrations based on the breath test read-out. During the final phase, we will validate these models in an independent group of patients to proof the clinical transferability of breath-based tests to guide drug dosage on an individual basis. This project will have a tremendous impact on current pediatric TDM clinical practice by: i) enabling a more personalized treatment, hence reducing ineffective doses and adverse effects; ii) improving patients' outcome; iii) saving hospital costs and iv) gaining new insights on pharmacokinetic aspects such as key parameters governing the diffusion of drugs in the lungs.",Breath Tests; Theraputic Drug monitoring; Secondary Electrospray Ionization-High Resolution ; Drug Metabolomics; Pharmacokinetics,external_funding,Active,4487875,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,517,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

However, patients who receive advanced treatments also experience short and long term side effects. Approximately 75% of breast cancer patients experience cancer related cognitive impairment (CRCI) prior to, during, or after treatment. CRCI remains a significant long-term problem for about 35% of breast cancer survivors. CRCI may interfere with patients' self-care activities, such as ability to adhere to treatment, manage side effects, and re-integrate into the workforce, which can have a negative impact on their quality of life. Current studies provide conflicting evidence about subgroups of breast cancer patient who might be at higher risk for experiencing CRCI. Little is known about the contribution of genetic variations in the catecholaminergic and serotonergic pathways in the development and severity of CRCI. Finally, although acupuncture is being recommended for the management of hot-flashes and pain in cancer patients, there is little evidence that acupuncture can contribute to the management of CRCI.  The specific aims of this study are to:  Identify subgroups of breast cancer patients who are at higher risk for CRCI (accounting for demographic characteristics and clinical predictors) during the first 6 months after surgery Explore associations between catecholaminergic and serotonergic genes with CRCI subgroup membership Evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture to reduce CRCI  The aims of the study will be addressed with quantitative, prospective, longitudinal, observational data collected in the U.S. regarding symptom burden among breast cancer patients prior to surgery and up to 60 months post systemic treatment (Aims 1 and 2); Aim 3 will be addressed with data collected in Germany for a prospective, single blind, randomized, controlled, multi-group comparison trial, which examined the efficacy of acupuncture for alleviating multiple symptoms in breast cancer patients receiving radiotherapy.

To better understand sleep and arousal regulation in vertebrates, I will use two approaches to identify circuits and genes underlying these processes in zebrafish.

Genes linked to RLS provide an entry point into the circuits that promote arousal and disrupt sleep. Zebrafish homolog knockouts of the RLS-linked genes Meis1 and Skor1 induce hyperactivity and sleep fragmentation. I will identify what circuit changes underlie these phenotypes. Aim 2: I will develop a novel and non-invasive neuronal activity recording system to identify sleep- or wake-active cells. This system will convert neuronal activity into patterns of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing of a DNA barcode during inducible time windows.

Yet a phase-out policy as a way to destabilize incumbent socio-technical regimes has drawn limited attention, unlike ""phase-in"" of clean technologies. Coal is still a major energy supply and largest source of CO2 emissions in many countries. We conduct a comparative case study to investigate why some jurisdictions covered more ground in coal phase-out while others failed to bring it even on the political agenda. Since phase-out policies are especially prone to political contestations, we focus on actors influencing national energy policies, their interests and agency to explain the different trajectories across cases with respect to coal phase-out.  This project focuses on in-depth analyses of 4 cases; Alberta (Canada), Australia, Germany and Japan. They are all large CO2 emitters, but their coal phase-out trajectories are diverse. Their trajectories display counter- evident patterns to theory-driven expectations in political economy and transition research, given their coal production and trade profile. To explain this gap, we adapt an interdisciplinary approach in analyzing the evolution of discourses, actors' resource endowments and their practices. We employ mixed methods consisting of surveys, document analysis and semi-structured interviews, followed both by qualitative and quantitative analyses.

Although pharmacological treatment with methylphenidate (MPH) reduces these deficits, it does not normalize the recipients in the long-term. Evidence, albeit limited, suggests that exercise may enhance the cognitive benefits of pharmacological treatment. Due to a unique combination of physical exertion, cognitive demands and promotion of discipline, martial arts particularly have the potential to be an effective additional component of ADHD therapy. However, possible benefits of martial arts have not yet been examined in children with ADHD. Purpose: The study aims to examine the effects of a 12-week judo training program on executive function and behavioral symptoms in children with ADHD. Possible benefits are investigated on a neurocognitive level to gain insights on the subtle processes that may contribute to exercise-induced enhancements within this cognitive domain. Additionally, the association between changes in neurophysiological indices of executive function and gains in motor skills as well as aerobic fitness are examined. Method: The study utilizes a randomized-controlled design, in which 56 children with ADHD are allocated to a martial arts group or a (wait-list) control group in a 1:1 ratio. Whereas the control group is encouraged to maintain their usual sports participation, a 12-week martial arts program with 120-min per week is prescribed to the martial arts group.

Whilst the first two decades after independence were still informed by narratives of hope and promises of a better future, the economic crises and the incisive Structural Adjustment Programmes at the end of the 1970s ushered a new era of what was later labelled as ""the lost decade"". Since then, many African countries lurched from one crisis to the next. Even stronger states as Côte d'Ivoire - once the ""African miracle"" - experienced severe downturns that led into prolonged crises and eventually into a decade of rebellion and civil war. However, the decades after 1980 were not merely a time of decline and muddling through - as some analysts claim -, they were also and sometimes even predominantly a time of social and political reconfiguration which lead many Africans to remodel their own future. Côte d'Ivoire's northern savannahs are no exception: when the post-colonial state weakened, local communities began to contest its hegemony; their repression and exclusion from political participation. They increasingly sought for more autonomous forms of social organisation. This transformation continues to affect all spheres of life, in particular social organisation at the local level. Acephalous forms of social structuration resurface in many rural areas, but to some extent also in urban neighbourhoods where neither state nor rebel governance delivered what the populace expected. In other places, stronger regimes could establish themselves, building on state as well as non-state repertoires of governance. Today, different and often diverging forms of social organisation and governance co-exist, which allows ordinary people to situate themselves in a context of their choice. The longue durée of these social and political transformations has been documented by Till Förster since 1979 when he began to conduct field work in the area on a regular basis. Building on a total of nine years of field research that also include the military insurgency 2002-2011 and its aftermath, this project aims at answering three related questions that are central to understand these transformations: - How do individual and collective actors relate to each other and structure the social? - How do diverging social and political regimes articulate to each other? - What can we learn from these transformations with regard to social and political theory? The project is sub-divided into two parts: Part I covers the scholarly dimension by elaborating on the theme of hegemony and autonomy. This part is the subject of the SNSF application for funding. Part II narrates the the visual dimension of these transformations on the basis of the applicants photographic archive collected since 1979. This part is the subject of a separate application for funding related to an exhibition and catalogue at the Museum der Kulturen Basel and the Fotomuseum Museum Winterthur that will also travel to African partner institutions. Part I Hegemony and Autonomy (SNSF funding) has two aims: a) the descriptive conflation and analysis of ethnographic findings from 1979 through the present, and b) their scrutinisation within the larger framework of social and political theory. Three Work Packages will I make older ethnographic data accessible. A student assistant is needed for this part. WP II fills minor research gaps by two short fieldtrips to trace social change into the present. This supplemental research will be conducted in the places where field work was already conducted since the 1970s, based on the Emic Evaluation Approach as strictly inductive methodology that has been adopted successfully in several SNSF-funded research projects on violent conflicts in Africa since about two decades. WP III consists of deskwork and regular exchanges with eminent scholars in the field but mainly of conceiving and writing a comprehensive book relevant to general debates in theories of social change. For this part, an experienced scientific collaborator is needed who can also teach and publish together with the applicant. The project is embedded in an international network of research partnerships. African partners are three regional universities (Korhogo, Bouaké, Bobo Dioulasso), other international partners come from the AEGIS network in Europe.

Physiologically, Ca2+ signals result both from the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (endo/sarcoplasmic reticulum) as well as influx from the extracellular environment, via the opening of channels on the plasma membrane. The Ca2+ that is stored in the endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum is released into the cytoplasm via the opening of intracellular calcium channels belonging to the inositol trisphosphate receptor and ryanodine receptor family.Type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) is the channel responsible for releasing Ca2+ from skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum after plasma membrane depolarization. RyR1plays a fundamental role in muscle physiology as illustrated by the fact that ryr1-/- mice die immediately after birth and that in humans, mutations in RYR1, the gene encoding the RyR1, lead to several neuromuscular disorders including Malignant Hyperthermia, Core myopathies, Centronuclear myopathy, Congenital Fiber Type Dysproportion and exertional heat stroke. The disease phenotype resulting from RYR1 mutations largely depends on their location within the RYR1 coding sequence and whether the mutations are dominant or recessive. Dominant mutations are more commonly associated with the Malignant Hyperthermia Susceptibility/exertional rhabdomyolysis and Central Core Disease phenotypes, while most cases of Multiminicore Disease, Centronuclear myopathy and Congenital Fiber Type Dysproportion phenotypes are associated with recessive mutations. From a general point of view, dominant RYR1 mutations affect the biophysical properties of the Ca2+ channel, while recessive mutations have a more modest effect on the biophysical properties of the Ca2+ channel, and their precise mode of action has not been investigated in detail. A consistent finding in muscle biopsies of patients with autosomal recessive RYR1 myopathies is the significant decrease of RyR1 protein; a decrease in sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ channels would be associated with less Ca2+ release leading to less efficient muscle contraction and weaker muscles. In the past few years our research has focused on understanding the mechanisms responsible for the drastic decrease in RyR1 content. Our results have shown that profound epigenetic modifications occur in muscles of patients with recessive RYR1 mutations, including RYR1 CpG island hyper-methylation, decrease in muscle-specific microRNA content and abnormal expression of class II histone deacetylases. Interestingly, a decrease in RyR1 protein in the muscles of patients with congenital myopathies caused by mutations in other genes including MTM1, SELENON, NEB hve also been observed, indicating that a common pathomechanism of disease, consequent to the primary genetic mutation, may exist.The aim of this project is to gain insight into the mechanisms causing the epigenetic modifications and validate whether they represent valid pharmacological targets. In order to do this we will use a knock in animal model we have generated, carrying two RYR1 mutations that were identified in a severely affected patient (namely RYR1 p.Q1970fx/p.A4329D). We will examine whether (i) skeletal muscles from the mouse model exhibit similar pathophysiological and epigenetic changes as those reported in human patients and (ii) investigate whether class II HDAC and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors constitute suitable pharmacological agents to improve the muscle function of the RYR1 mutant mouse model. Additionally we will investigate the muscles of human patients with congenital myopathies that share as a common feature reduced RyR1 protein content, in order to verify whether common molecular signatures caused by the altered activity of enzymes involved in chromatin modification (HDACs and DNA methylating enzymes) occur.

Multipole force fields will be extended to treat general spectroscopic applications (1- and 2-dimensional infrared spectroscopy), using fluctuating multipoles and describing the energetics of the nuclear degrees of freedom with reproducing kernels. Applications include spectroscopic probes such as -CO, -NO and -N3 for which accurate, fully dimensional potential energy surfaces can be calculated. This will be used to characterize the site-specific dynamics and functional motions of proteins such as insulin, lysozyme, myoglobin and nitrophorin in solution. For insulin, analysis of motions at the dimerization interface will be used to quantify the physiologically relevant monomer/dimer equilibrium which is difficult to do with experimentally established, thermodynamic approaches. To account for vibrational coherences, partial linearized density matrix (PLDM) propagation will be generalized for vibrational dynamics (vPLDM).

Our goal is to provide empirical evidence on the strengths, weaknesses and the impact on treatment effect estimates of pragmatism, applicability and generalizability beyond the theoretical expectations of their value in the decision-making process of patient care.Objectives: (1) To set up the PragMeta database, which will include trials investigating the same clinical questions but having different aspects of generalizability, applicability and pragmatism; (2) to descriptively characterize those aspects using the PRECIS-2 score and specific trial population- and setting-related determinants of generalizability (for example strict or broad eligibility criteria) and applicability (for example highly controlled environment versus routine care); and (3) to determine their impact on the treatment effect estimatesDesign and Methods: This is a meta-epidemiological study of published trials. We will work in a large international research collaboration, with key experts in the field, to incorporate and share in the PragMeta database large already available datasets of pragmatic trials, supplemented by specific systematic searches of pragmatic and explanatory trials on the same clinical questions. Standard methods of systematic reviewing, meta-analysis and meta-epidemiology will be used. We will compare treatment effects from pragmatic versus explanatory trials and from trials with versus without specific determinants of pragmatism, generalizability, and applicability using meta- regressions and the ratio of odds ratio method. We plan to include over 2000 trials that will be representative of the pragmatic-explanatory continuum.Relevance of the project: The cornerstone of real world evidence is that treatment effects under real world conditions in routine care may differ from that in highly controlled research settings, such as in drug approval trials. The PragMeta project aims to provide a better understanding of the pragmatic-explanatory continuum, and the generation and interpretation of real world evidence. It will give practical guidance for clinicians, researchers, regulators, health insurers and health-care policy makers, developers of reporting guidelines, and other stakeholders who develop, fund, conduct, assess or otherwise use clinical trials. Ultimately it may help to generate, report and use evidence that is more relevant for patients, clinicians and other key health care decision-makers.",NA,external_funding,Active,4514719,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,528,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

It contributes to the long term goal of finding realistic architectures that allow the coherent manipulation of solid state systems at the quantum level. Since this goal necessarily involves the study of complex many-body systems, our research goes across many subfields of modern condensed matter and solid state theory and uses a very broad range of sophisticated technical tools.The strategy we pursue encompasses the refinement of the well-established scheme of spin-based quantum computing, as well as efforts to discover novel and realistic platforms that allow the storage and manipulation of quantum information. In view of the desired industrial feasibility and scalability of the results, we focus on the solid state as the basis of our research. Exciting and promising new materials will be examined and their suitability for quantum information processing will be evaluated. Moreover, we will study intriguing issues that are also of interest in fundamental research, ranging from exotic types of topological quantum phases to non- equilibrium dynamics, with focus on spin effects in semiconducting, superconducting, and insulating magnetic nanostructures. Also these fundamental aspects of our proposal are targeted on the ability to gain access to the quantum world.

Suramin is a fascinating molecule with a wide array of potential applications, from parasitic and viral diseases to cancer and autism. Suramin is also an enigmatic molecule: What are its targets in African trypanosomes? And how does it get into the trypanosomes in the first place? Due to its size and negative charge, suramin is likely imported via receptor-mediated endocytosis, and the receptor in T. brucei bloodstream forms is thought to be the invariant surface glycoprotein ISG75. Nevertheless, we have recently identified a variant surface glycoprotein, termed VSGSur, expression of which is sufficient to render T. brucei bloodstream forms 100-fold resistant to suramin. While VSGSur-mediated resistance is independent of ISG75, it is linked to the endocytosis of low density lipoprotein. Expression of VSGSur in T. brucei affects selected membrane receptors, impairing the endocytosis of LDL and of transferrin, but not of the trypanolytic factor or of VSG itself. Our findings support the model of two independent pathways for suramin endocytosis, via ISG75 or via the LDL receptor, whereby the latter is disturbed by VSGSur. Interestingly, further in vitro selection of VSGSur expressing trypanosomes with suramin yielded a VSGSur variant with several point mutations. This variant, termed VSGSupersur, causes even stronger suramin resistance than VSGSur when expressed in T. brucei. Selection for high-level suramin resistance combined with genomics also provided a new candidate for the intracellular target of suramin. The suramin-resistant trypanosomes became homozygous for a non-synonymous point mutation in a DNA helicase of T. brucei, and the same residue turned out to be mutated also in a suramin-resistant field isolate of T. evansi. DNA helicase is a known antiviral target of suramin but has so far not been implicated in the trypanocidal action of suramin. Here we propose to further dissect these promising leads, aiming to understand the molecular mechanisms of suramin action and resistance, and thereby identifying also the LDL receptor of T. brucei.

"Willi, Yvonne",NA,Departement Umweltwissenschaften / Pflanzenökologie und -evolution (Willi),Understanding the genotype-phenotype-fitness maps at species' range limits,2019,"Background: The causes of geographic range limits are unresolved. What we know so far is that roughly half of current range limits are due to dispersal limitation while the other half are due to constraints on adaptation to environmental conditions at range edges. Simple evolutionary principles suggest that limits to adaptation must stem from either the shape of environmental gradients imposing selection or the genetics of traits on which selection acts. Hence, natural selection is the link between the two types of limitation. This is the focus of this research proposal; the goal is to study the selection regime at range edges, the shape of change in the selection regime from within the range to beyond the range edge, and the targets of selection: the traits, pathways and genes involved. Hypotheses: Theory is not specific about the shape of environmental change causing range limits, but all models agree that steep changes in environmental gradients can attract range limits. The main hypothesis to be tested is that steep environmental gradients, known from niche modelling, translate into selection intensity on the genome and on traits at the current range limit. For genetic limits to adaptation, theory predicts that genetic variation for key traits is low throughout the distribution or that multiple traits are strongly correlated in specific ways. Therefore, the hypotheses for genetic limitations are that selection at the edge acts on traits with generally low genetic variation or that multivariate selection is antagonistic to the genetic correlation matrix. Procedure: I propose a large scale selection experiment and assessment of phenotype, genotype and fitness at four range edges of the North American Arabidopsis lyrata. At all edges, three sites on a transect will be included - one within the range but close to the edge, one at the edge and one beyond the edge. Previous work shows that these edges are characterized by steep climatic gradients. The plant material will stem from one large outcrossing population from the current center of distribution, which will first be propagated in the greenhouse for one generation to produce seeds of 300 unrelated families. I will profile the genotype of each family by whole-genome sequencing of both parental plants, revealing family allele frequencies for each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) site. In the greenhouse (N = 300 seed families . 5 stress treatments . 6 plants) and at each selection site (N = 12 sites . 300 seed families . 8 tubs), we will collect data on growth trajectory, phenology, survival and reproductive output. We will (1) estimate G-matrices of growth and phenology under different niche-relevant stress factors (greenhouse study and outdoors), (2) associate tolerance traits assessed in the greenhouse and performance outdoors with SNPs - producing genotype-phenotype-fitness maps, (3) link selection intensities with environmental conditions outdoors and (4) study antagonistic genetic interactions in traits and in selection. Importance: Although natural selection is a key process in all areas of evolutionary ecology, few studies have estimated how selection varies along environmental gradients. Changes in selection at range limits have never been investigated in nature. This project will address these major gaps. Important answers can be expected in regard to the relation between environmental gradients and selection, the relative importance of selection versus genetic constraints in adaptive evolution, and why adaptation to environmental change can fail.",NA,external_funding,Active,4500651,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,531,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"Boeck, Lucas",NA,Departement Biomedizin; Bereich Medizinische Fächer (Klinik) / Pneumologie,Molecular basis of Mycobacterium Abscessus heterogeneity during stress,2019,"The evolutionary success of bacteria lies, to a large degree, in their adaptability; none more so than environmental mycobacteria. They have acquired multiple strategies to survive a large spectrum of stresses, and some, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis managed to evolve from an environmental niche to become an obligate human pathogen.The focus of my proposal is Mycobacterium abscessus, a nontuberculous mycobacterium which has recently emerged as the most lethal and frequent multidrug-resistant mycobacterial infection in the developed world. M. abscessus infections are frequently impossible to treat despite prolonged combination antibiotic therapy and, at least in individuals with Cystic Fibrosis, cause accelerated lung damage and prevent safe lung transplantation. To date, the molecular strategies used by M. abscessus to resist antibiotics and escape host immune responses remain largely unknown but are likely to result from interactions between mycobacterial and non-mycobacterial virulence programmes (the latter acquired through horizontal gene transfer from other bacterial species). I have recently identified many of the critical gene networks controlling M. abscessus infection, virulence, and antimicrobial resistance through a multidimensional GWAS analysis of clinical isolates (Boeck et al in preparation). I now wish to examine how the generation of phenotypic heterogeneity by genetically identical bacteria may help M. abscessus adapt to changing environmental stresses. To do so, I will undertake three orthogonal experimental approaches (outlined below) to quantify mycobacterial heterogeneity, define the molecular basis underlying heterogeneity, and examine its functional implications during stress: Aim A: Single-cell dynamics of M. abscessus during stressOur knowledge of bacteria is almost exclusively based on the study of bulk populations. Particularly during stress (e.g. exposure to antibiotics) a large number of phenotypically different states emerge, which cannot be assessed by traditional approaches. In order to capture replication and functional dynamics I will use a custom-made microfluidic device to track millions of individual mycobacteria over time. This will allow me to characterise heterogeneity across different genetic backgrounds and during exposure to different stresses. Aim B: Genetic drivers for M. abscessus heterogeneity Phenotypic heterogeneity occurs in genetically identical individuals, mainly due to variations in transcription. The degree of phenotypic heterogeneity, however, is specified within and variable across genetic backgrounds, i.e. is a heritable genetic trait. I will combine a bacterial genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach with a forward genetic screen to identify drivers of mycobacterial heterogeneity during stress; in order to identify molecular mechanisms of involved stress pathways and heterogeneity formation. Aim C: Functional networks of stress induced M. abscessus subpopulationsThe functional properties of stress tolerant bacteria are poorly understood, and several misconceptions prevail, particularly that bacterial persistence is exclusively mediated via dormancy, a metabolically inactive state. To characterise their functional properties during stress I will define the transcriptional networks active in specific phenotypic subpopulations of M. abscessus, and develop a functional framework for how persistence is activated and maintained.",NA,external_funding,Active,4512348,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,532,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

While specific bimodal programs were implicated in bacterial virulence 1 and antibiotic tolerance 2, the mechanisms leading to bi-nary cellular responses and the resulting consequences for population fitness and resilience are often unclear. Here, we aim at dissecting the role of two novel toxin-antitoxin (TA) modules in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one of three human pathogens recently listed as critical-priority by the WHO. One of the hallmarks of bacterial TA systems is the binary expression of toxins or toxin-like factors, leading to the generation of functional heterogeneity in bacterial populations. We hypoth-esize that the TA modules PA1029-PA1030 and PA2780-PA2781 contribute to behavioral heteroge-neity and antibiotic tolerance of cultures of P. aeruginosa and by that contribute to the establish-ment of successful infections. To strengthen this idea, we propose to embark on a thorough func-tional examination of both modules.In the first part of the project, we plan to dissect the regulation and function of the toxin PA1030 and its antitoxin PA1029. Activating mutations in the PA1030 gene were originally identified in isolates of chronically infected CF patients and were shown to confer strongly increased tolerance against different classes of antibiotics. Our preliminary data suggest that stochastic expression of PA1030 generates persisters by modulating the cellular NAD pool. We propose a combination of biochemical, structural and cell biology experiments to determine the mechanisms of toxin action on the cells' metabolism and its stochastic control. These experiments will test the central hypoth-esis that the PA1029-PA1030 TA module generates persisters upon sensing the depletion of a cen-tral metabolite. We will investigate the role of this TA module in chronic infections by characterizing TA variants from clinical isolates and by quantifying the expression of the TA components in pa-tient samples. In the second part of the project, we will dissect the TA-like module PA2780-PA2781, which through its stochastic expression generates behavioral diversity in P. aeruginosa cells colonizing surfaces to form biofilms. Biofilms are multicellular communities that strongly promote chronic infections by protecting pathogens from phagocytic clearance and safeguarding bacteria from an-tibiotic killing. Based on preliminary results, we hypothesize that PA2780-PA2781 converts regu-latory input from the global Gac/Rsm cascade into a binary cellular response, generating pheno-typic heterogeneity through the control of c-di-GMP-dependent processes like virulence, biofilm formation and persistence. We postulate that this system provides P. aeruginosa with a bet-hedging strategy to functionally diversify during infection and colonization of host tissues. Our studies will uncover the mechanisms of stochastic expression and downstream processes of this TA-like mod-ule and will investigate its role in P. aeruginosa virulence and persistence. ","Antibiotic tolerance, Toxin-antitoxin module, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Biofilm formation, Phenotypic heterogeneity, stochastic binary gene expression, chronic infection",external_funding,Active,4514414,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,533,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"Kuhle, Jens",NA,Departement Klinische Forschung; Bereich Medizinische Fächer (Klinik) / Neuroimmunologie (Kappos),Towards development of neurofilament light chain as precision medicine biomarker for multiple sclerosis,2019,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease that has neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative features. The neuroinflammatory component appears to be driven by the immune system in the 'periphery', while in parallel, and partly independent, a CNS-compartmentalised neurodegenerative processes takes place (1). The advent of highly efficacious therapies like natalizumab, alemtuzumab and rituximab/ocrelizumab has led to a near complete control of relapse activity in most patients. In contrast, progression (disability worsening independent of relapses) as the clinical manifestation of neurodegeneration remains an unmet medical need as even the most effective compounds fall short in controlling steady progression (2;3). There are two major barriers for the development of more effective therapies for progressive MS (PMS) as well as for other neurodegenerative disease: i) in the clinic, the disease process is manifest only when the functional reserve begins to be exhausted, i.e. at a time point when neuronal loss is already in an advanced stage, and ii) no surrogate biomarker is available that allows to detect and monitor the subclinical neurodegenerative processes.In our previous project (320030_160221 / 1), we developed and validated the concept that the concentration of serum or plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) in MS is a biomarker of a) disease activity, b) drug response, and is c) predictive of long-term disease course. Based on collaborations with other research groups, we also contributed significantly to the validation of NfL as a biomarker of neuro-axonal damage and loss in primary neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other forms of dementia, spinal cord injury, stroke, or neonatal brain injury. The ability to quantify, for the first time, neuro-axonal injury from a blood-derived specimen marks a breakthrough for biomarker research in neurology. The goal of our new project is to bring our knowledge of NfL biology to a level at which it can be utilised as precision medicine tool for individual patients.First, we aim to elucidate mechanisms that lead to the NfL increases observed in stable relapsing forms of MS and in PMS, and to determine the impact of acute versus chronic active lesions on the levels of NfL. This will be achievable based on our collaborations with MRI research teams at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV) and the University Hospital Basel (USB). Furthermore, based on preliminary data from the Swiss MS Cohort Study (SMSC), we have a unique opportunity to identify individual patients that exhibit a suboptimal treatment response, and who would have benefited from a personalised therapy scheme. In these cases, it is our hypothesis that the increased NfL blood levels signal the presence of continuous subclinical disease activity and indicates that these patients are likely to benefit from therapy escalation. We have the ability to address these issues now because we were able to create the SMSC - a well-characterised cohort of more than 1300 MS patients with long-term follow-up (FU). Furthermore, the collaboration between the Swiss MS Registry (SMSR) and the SMSC will allow us to investigate the association of serum NfL (sNfL) with patient reported outcome measures of quality of life.Second, we will develop highly sensitive assays for myelin components (myelin basic protein and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein) to quantify demyelination in MS based on Single Molecule Array (SIMOA) technology, building on our vast previous experience with this technique and allowing to contextualise the sNfL biomarker signal in MS.Third, we want to determine the turnover rate and half-life time of blood NfL in rodent models of MS (collaboration with the Dept. of Pharmacology, University of Oxford), as the lack of its knowledge is a main hurdle for using of sNfL for individualised monitoring purposes.Lastly, based on international collaborations with academic centres in Switzerland, Germany and the USA, we will establish a normative data base (NDB) including more than 11'000 healthy persons to correct for the age-dependency of the sNfL signal, and to evaluate the impact of comorbidities, which is a prerequisite for accurate interpretation of individual measuring results. In addition, the size and available clinical, samples and MRI FU within the NDB collaborations will allow us to evaluate the predictive value of sNfL on future pathology detected clinically or by MRI in currently 'healthy persons'.The successful completion of these work packages is essential if sNfL levels are to be established as the first biofluid marker to quantify present and to predict future neurodegenerative processes in MS, and to support therapeutic decision making in individual patients for personalised medicine.",NA,external_funding,Active,4514416,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,534,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

What is still missing, however, is the functional link between genetic variants for host resistance and parasite infectivity on the level of individual interactions and genomic signatures that are predicted to result from these interactions. In this research proposal-a continuation of my previous SNF grant-I address this topic, focusing on a well-established host-parasite system: the water flea Daphnia magna and its virulent bacterial parasite Pasteuria ramosa. This model system has the potential to reveal the mechanistic connection between resistance and infectivity on the individual level and genomic variation at the species level. Our work may thus serve as a case study for demonstrating how selection on specific host- parasite interactions creates genomic patterns of long-term balancing selection and trans-species polymorphism. The proposed research has three main aims, each with two subprojects (SPs): Aim 1: Identify resistance and infectivity genes: We will use genomic approaches to screen hosts (SP1) and parasites (SP2) for loci related to their interactions, with the overarching aim of understanding how these genes interact to produce phenotypic variation. Specifically, we will map genes for polymorphisms in host resistance and parasite infection using stratified genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Aim 2: Long-term consequences of coevolution: Here we will analyse genomes of D. magna and two related species, D. similis and D. sinensis, for long-term balancing selection and trans-species polymorphism (TSP). SP3 will focus on a known host supergene for resistance, a gene so diverse that it requires a haplotype approach, using long-read sequencing. SP4 will employ candidate-free genome scans to search for signatures of balancing selection and TSP in genotypes of the three species collected over a broad geographic scale. Aim 3: Short-term dynamics of coevolution: Genomes of naturally infected hosts will be sequenced together with those of the infecting parasite. These data will be used to test directly for genetic interactions between host and parasite loci, i.e. interspecies linkage disequilibrium (SP5). Variation at the resulting host and parasite candidate loci will then be tracked over two years in longitudinal samples from a natural population and also in sediment cores taken from the same population (SP6). This will allow us to follow coevolution at the interacting genes over time spans from years to decades. SP6 depends on results from SP5. These subprojects complement each other, promising to create a comprehensive picture of the nature and dynamics of the genes that underlay coevolutionary interactions of this system over both the short-term (via patterns of parasitism and selection) and the long-term (via genomic signatures). The proposed research will close the gap between theory, individual level patterns of disease and genomic signatures at disease loci.

TB causes more human deaths than any other infectious disease, and TB in livestock leads to a global estimated loss of three billion US dollars per year. The main agents of TB are a group of closely related bacteria known as the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex (MTBC), which differ in their host tropism. The MTBC Lineages 1 to 7 are human-adapted, and several other MTBC lineages, or ecotypes, mainly affect different wild and domestic animal species. Among the latter, Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium caprae are the most important agents of TB in livestock and also the most important causes of zoonotic TB in humans. Recently, there has been an increase in cases of Mycobacterium orygis reported among immigrants from South Asia, indicating that this ecotype has the potential to cause zoonotic disease in humans. During the last few years, analyses of large globally representative collections of whole genome sequences from the human-adapted MTBC lineages have enhanced our understanding of the global population structure, phylogeography and evolutionary history of these pathogens. By contrast, little corresponding data exist for the various animal-adapted ecotypes of the MTBC. This is particularly true for M. bovis, M. caprae and M. orygis, for which most available data comes from convenience samples generated in high-income countries such as UK, USA and New Zealand. As a result, the global population structure, phylogeography and evolutionary history of these ecotypes remain unknown. Moreover, although we and others have shown that M. bovis, M. caprae and M. orygis are phylogenetically separate entities, whether these phylogenetic distances reflect ecological separation with respect to host tropism is unclear. The general view is that M. bovis has a broader host tropism compared to other members of the MTBC, but in M. caprae and M. orygis, the main maintenance host, and host tropism in general, are poorly defined, particularly with respect to their zoonotic potential. The overall goal of this project is to define the global population structure, phylogeography, evolutionary history and genomic diversity of M. bovis, M. caprae and M. orygis, and to explore the genomic and phenotypic determinants of host tropism in these animal-adapted members of the MTBC. We hypothesize that i) M. bovis, M. caprae and M. orygis exhibit a phylogeographical population structure that reflects events in domestication, animal husbandry, human migration and trade, ii) M. bovis, M. caprae and M. orygis differ in their host tropism and zoonotic potential, iii) these differences in host tropism are reflected in evolutionary signatures in the genomes of these pathogens, and iv) manifest in the phenotypic features of the corresponding host-pathogen interactions measured ex vivo. We will test these hypotheses by addressing the following three Specific Objectives:1.Determine the global population structure, phylogeography and evolutionary history of M. bovis, M. caprae and M. orygis;2.Explore the genomic basis of host tropism in M. bovis, M. caprae and M. orygis;3.Identify phenotypic correlates of host tropism in matched- and mismatched host macrophages infected with M. bovis, M. caprae or M. orygis.We propose an integrated and multidisciplinary approach, in which we combine i) detailed analyses of large, globally representative collections of M. bovis, M. caprae or M. orygis genome sequences generated using both short- and long sequencing read technologies, ii) application of state-of-the-art population genomic, phylogenomic, phylogeographic and molecular dating methods, and iii) functional assays based on host-pathogen matched- and mismatched macrophage infections analysed for intracellular bacterial growth, host-pathogen cross-talk using dual RNAseq, and host innate immune responses. In addition, we will study the relative zoonotic potential of these three ecotypes by infecting human macrophages. This project will generate fundamental new insights into the global genomic population structure, phylogeography and evolutionary history of the main agents of TB in livestock and the most important causes of zoonotic TB in humans.

Amphiphilic block-copolymers are particularly appealing to be used in such bottom-up approaches because they self-assemble in dilute solutions into various supramolecular assemblies with distinct architectures and properties, allowing their combination with active compounds, such as catalysts, metal complexes and biomolecules. The functionality of such new hybrid materials and systems is provided by the active compounds, while the supramolecular assemblies serve as templates/compartments/membranes bringing robustness and stability as key factors for translational applications.In this project we plan to synthesize new amphiphilic diblock and triblock copolymers with hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains and properties (stimuli-responsiveness, flexibility, presence of functional end-groups) allowing encapsulation/insertion/attachment of biomolecules. The self-assembly of these amphiphilic copolymers will result in formation of supramolecular assemblies in solution (vesicles, micelles, nanoparticles) and hybrid membranes (lipid-polymer and polymer-polymer) on solid supports. The synthesis of different libraries of amphiphilic copolymers will allow a systematic investigation of the resulting supramolecular assemblies and membranes to favor specific interactions with biomolecules and develop complex hybrid systems with desired functionality. Of particular interest are the triblock copolymers with different hydrophilic domains because the resulting membranes will be intrinsically asymmetric and will favor directed insertion of biomolecules, for example of membrane proteins. In addition, the presence of hydrophilic domains with specific properties, as for example chirality, will enable control of the self-assembled architecture and even self-organization of such assemblies, while the presence of specific molecules exposed at the hydrophilic surface of the assemblies will support their interactions with biomolecules.Nanostructured membranes will be developed by combinations of copolymers with lipids, or of copolymers with different properties in a variety of ratios and conditions to modulate their phase separation. Heterogeneity introduced at the surface level will support specific combinations with bioactive molecules to engineer ""smart"" complex surfaces.

Insertion of membrane proteins inside the copolymer membranes spanning the pores, will allow a molecular flow through, which will support the reactions inside the confined cells.

Endress-Stiftungsprofessur für Experimentalphysik (Maletinsky),Exploring nanoscale magnetic phenomena using a quantum microscope,2019,"Quantum sensing technologies harness quantum phenomena, such as superposition or entanglement, to yield powerful sensors for quantities such as electric and magnetic fields, strain or temperature. Over the last years, such quantum sensors and in particular magnetometers based on individual spins in diamond have seen remarkable progress, in part based on the successful research and technological developments by the applicant's group at the University of Basel. Our state-of-the art quantum magnetometers, today offer spatial resolutions ~20 nm, magnetic field sensitivities sufficient to detect single electron spins and operate from cryogenic to ambient conditions. Their performance is thereby at the forefront of modern-day nanoscale sensing technologies and offer a highly attractive approach to address a wide range of challenging topics in nanoscience and technology, whose impact ranges from the life-sciences over semiconductor technologies to the fundamental physics questions we target here.In this project, we will build on this outstanding performance to address pressing open questions relevant to present-day research in condensed matter and mesoscopic physics. Specifically, we will employ our magnetometers to the emerging field of antiferromagnetic spintronics, to high-frequency dynamics of ferromagnets and to the low-temperature physics of superconductors and two-dimensional magnets in the atomic monolayer limit. Next to quantitative imaging of static magnetic spin textures or supercurrents, we will employ and further develop approaches to sense and image high-frequency magnetic fields with high resolution and sensitivity. Our novel and unique approach is ideally suited to yield insight into these physical systems, which is not readily accessible otherwise. Examples include the nanoscale probing and imaging of magnetic ordering in antiferromagnets, of spin-wave propagation in magnetic nanostructures or of magnetic ordering in atomically thin, silicene-based ferromagnets, which we will perform within this project. The scientific insights these studies will yield will have far-reaching impact in physics and material sciences and will offer new views on magnetism on the nanoscale.The main applicant is Prof. Dr. Patrick Maletinsky, an associate professor and head of the QuantumSensing Group, which he founded at the University of Basel in 2012. He has a strong background in quantum sensing, quantum optics, mesoscopic physics and nanotechnology. He obtained his physics diploma and doctoral degree at ETH Zurich and performed research in some of the world-leading research laboratories such as JILA or Harvard University. Together with international collaborators including the CNRS in France, research groups in Germany, Russia and Japan, and collaborators throughout Switzerland (Basel, ETH, EPFL, Geneva) this project establishes a coordinated, international effort to push the frontiers of condensed matter physics and nanotechnology using our novel, high-performance quantum sensors.Here we ask for the renewal of our soon to be concluded, three-year SNF project #169321, during which we have already achieved key breakthroughs of single-spin magnetometry in, e.g., the fields of antiferromagnetic spintronics or van-der-Waals magnetism. The present, challenging proposal builds on these achievements to not only advance our field or research but also further strengthen Switzerland's leading role quantum technology development and modern condensed matter research.

"Meyer, Ernst",NA,Departement Physik / Nanomechanik (Meyer),Neue Einsichten in die Sonden-Proben-Wechselwirkung bei den Rastersondenmethoden,2019,"This research proposal focuses on the progress in the study of local interactions by Scanning Probe Methods (SPM). The research in this field is only possible due to our longstanding experience and equipment:Nanolino: STM/AFM force microscopy in ultrahigh vacuumLT-SPM: Combined low temperature scanning tunneling and force microscopyThe following research topics will be addressed in this period:a) High resolution tunneling and force spectroscopy of Majorana bound statesIn this research, we pursue our investigations of magnetic chains on superconductors, grown by self-assembly or atom-by-atom via tip manipulations, with a particular focus on growing perfect chain structures. Their characterizations will be conducted with advanced SPM techniques in order to disentangle electronic properties, spin texture and atomic structure. We are acquiring a new ultra-low temperature tuning fork microscope operated at 900 mK under a variable magnetic field of ± 3T with He holding times of about 150 hours that will be set up during this research period. Beside the topological chains, we also investigate new condensed-matter systems to realize synthetic topological superconductors based on two dimensional materials and potentially hosting Majorana fermions (MFs). We thus focus on the on-surface synthesis of doped graphene nano-structures as well as the epitaxy of silicene atomic layers. Not appropriate for Pb substrates due to its low melting temperature, these synthesis will be transferred to atomically-cleaned niobium surfaces prepared in ultra-high vacuum.b) Pulling of molecular wires along surfacesOur main focus for this research period is on the pulling of single molecular wires with predefined mechanical properties. For this purpose, we will exploited the manipulation techniques developed in our group these last years. The metallic STM tip is approached to one end of the wire until a bond is formed. Then the tip is retracted in the vertical direction to detach the molecular wires unit after unit while recording its mechanical responses. These experiments are in analogy with our previous ones using graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and poly-fluorene chains. In the case of poly-pyrenylene-chains, we are particularly interest in detecting and controlling the effects of steric hindrance between consecutive sub-units of the chains. From ab initio calculations, it is expected that the free poly-pyrenylene molecules naturally promotes large twists about the single C-C bonds of ±40°, as a result of steric repulsions between adjacent hydrogen atoms. In a second phase, we wish to design new molecular chains with selected peripheral side groups or sub-units. The concept is to promote new mechanical dynamics upon lifting/sliding with different sub-units twist angles of the equilibrium form of the molecular chains. Consequently, we expect that cryo-force spectroscopic measurements observe different adhesive forces to detach the molecular units. In analogy to the pyrenylene case, we might observe variations of the maximum detachment force depending on the twisting direction (clock- vs. anti-clock wise).c) Friction and contact forces with large molecules prepared by electrospray depositionWe will use electrospray deposition to deposit large molecules, such as the hexadodecylhexabenzo-coronene, and extend this study to graphylene-1, also called the spoked wheel molecule. Several questions are to be addressed: 1) Do the molecules assemble on metallic and insulating substrates? The assembly on insulators is of importance for applications in optics and molecular electronics, where optical and electronic decoupling of the molecules from metallic substrates are required. 2) How is the assembly depending on the temperature? First evidence is found that large molecules with alkyl chains have temperature dependent inter-molecular spacing, which correspond to very large thermal expansion coefficients of the order of 10-4/°K.In the second period, individual large molecules will be moved by the probing tip and the frictional forces will be determined as a function of orientation, adsorption location and loading force. How do the frictional forces scale with the size of the molecules? Can we heat the molecules by exposure to tunneling currents or laser light? Does this increase the mobility or reduce the frictional forces. In the same spirit, we will prepare carbon onions and graphene nanoribbons, which will continue some the previous experiments on larger scales.",kelvin force microscopy; STM; SFM; force microscopy; SPM; scanning tunneling microscopy; non-contact force microscopy; surface science; insulators; atomic friction; Atomic and molecular resolution; true atomic resolution by AFM in ultrahigh vacuum,external_funding,Active,4514611,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,539,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"Neher, Richard",NA,Departement Biozentrum / Computational Modeling of Biological Processes (Neher),Recombination and reassortement in viral evolution,2019,"Very few organisms evolve exclusively by asexual vertical transmission of their genomes. Instead, most populations exchange genetic information horizontally via a diverse set of mechanisms with profound effects on genetic diversity, the evolutionary dynamics, and adaptive potential. Theoretical models predict that recombination accelerates adaptation and reduces mutation load. Recombination or horizontal transfer are hence expected to be beneficial on the long run despite its short-term costs. Empirical evidence for this effect, however, is sparse and largely limited to short evolution experiments. RNA viruses like HIV and influenza are ideal systems to study the interplay of recombination and adaptive evolution since they evolve rapidly, are densely sampled, and their biology is well understood. Recombination rates of HIV and influenza viruses are high enough to matter, but low enough that substantial linkage and clonal interference remains. Hence the competing effects of recombination and selection are directly observable.   In microbial evolution, recombination and reassortment are often the most impactful evolutionary events. Yet most phylogenetic analyses of viruses ignore recombination or seek to remove sequences with evidence of recombination. Here, we propose to develop computationally efficient and scalable methods to analyze recombination and reassortment in viruses and investigate how recombination facilitates adaptation and reduces recombination load.

"Zavolan, Mihaela",NA,Departement Biozentrum / Bioinformatics (Zavolan),"Cell type-specific expression of 3' untranslated region isoforms: quantification, modeling, and prediction of functional impact",2019,"The human body contains hundreds of cell types. Thus, a central challenge of modern biology is to uncover the principles that guide the formation and maintenance of this complex cellular landscape, from a single cell and based on the same genome sequence. Indeed, large scale initiatives such as the 'human cell atlas' are ongoing, aiming to comprehensively map cell states with a variety of technologies, including single cell sequencing. However, while most human genes express multiple isoforms, differing primarily in transcription start and termination sites, expression is mostly described at the 'gene level'. Furthermore, annotation of regulatory elements and their specific involvement in a particular cell remains sparse.The term alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) is used to describe the tissue-dependent choice of a poly(A) site among the many available within a gene. APA leads to expression of isoforms that differ in their protein-coding sequences (CDS) and/or in their 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs). During animal evolution, 3' UTRs have expanded from ~140 nucleotides in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans to 1-2 kilobases in humans, suggesting a parallel increase in the complexity of post-transcriptional regulation. Indeed, there is increasing evidence that APA contributes to cell identity. For instance, it has been reported that the cell type-specific pattern of expression of single-3'UTR genes is due preferentially to transcriptional regulation, and rather to changes in isoform ratios in the case of multi-UTR genes. Because 3' UTR isoforms differ in relative stability, localization, and translation rate, APA-dependent remodeling of 3' UTRs has many and far-reaching consequences on cell physiology. A very surprising finding has been that transcripts with distinct 3' UTRs can direct the localization of the (same) encoded protein to distinct cellular compartments. Although these findings made clear that much of the diversity of cellular phenotypes could come from differences in APA-dependent isoform expression, this possibility that has received relatively little consideration. Having established unique resources and methods in the field of APA, I here propose to develop a coherent set of synergistic methods to systematically annotate cell type-specific poly(A) sites and isoforms, quantify their usage at the single cell level, and model the regulation of cell type-specific isoform expression. Because the broadly used 10x Genomics technology for single cell sequencing captures precisely transcript 3' ends, we will exploit such data in combination with comprehensive genome-wide annotations of alternative poly(A) sites to quantify APA in single cells. We will develop new methods to systematically infer regulatory motifs for a large set of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) using extensive eCLIP data from ENCODE. Using these RBP motifs in combination with RNA sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, the human cell atlas and other consortia, we will model poly(A) site usage in terms of configurations of RBP binding sites, to infer how cell-type-dependent processing of poly(A) sites is regulated in physiological and pathological conditions. Finally, we will develop methods to assess the downstream effects of APA on RNA stability, localization, and translation. The resources generated in this project will be combined with data from large-scale initiatives, e.g. for personalized health, to link isoform expression to cellular morphology and phenotype, support identification of biomarkers, and the development of individualized therapies.","PWM, 3'UTR, modeling, single cell, Poly(A) site",external_funding,Active,4514641,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,541,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Although inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are highly effective in asthma, their effect in COPD is highly differentiated among patients. Thus, misuse of ICS in an unidentified population of COPD patients that do not respond to ICS results in serious side effects and economic burden. It is imperative therefore, to elucidate the mechanisms involved in ICS responsiveness in COPD. We are currently evaluating the responsiveness to ICS in a cohort of 188 COPD patients that participate in the HISTORIC study, an investigator-initiated and driven, controlled study in the Clinic of Pneumology, University Hospital Basel. Aim of the current proposal: To investigate cellular and molecular parameters associated with glucocorticoid responsiveness in COPD patients, using primary airway cells, established from endobronchial biopsies of the 188 COPD patients who participate in the HISTORIC study.Objectives: COPD patients (n=188) will be divided into ""responders"" and ""no-responders"" to ICS treatment. In each group we will: 1) establish airway smooth muscle cells (ASMC), bronchial epithelial cells (BEC) and fibroblasts from endobronchial biopsies; 2) assess the expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) isoforms, GRa and GRß in tissue sections of the airways, as well as in primary airway cells; 3) evaluate the activation of GR receptor in response to glucocorticoids in primary ASMC, BEC and fibroblasts; 4) study the expression, activation and nuclear binding of GR-interacting transcription factors, such as activator protein-1 (AP-1), nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), for their possible role in glucocorticoid unresponsiveness, in primary airway cells; 5) study gene and protein expression as well as the activity of histone deacetylase (HDAC) in primary airway cells and 6) characterize GR-regulated cellular signaling cascades. Methods: Primary ASMC, BEC and fibroblasts will be established from endobronchial biopsies from 188 patients included in the HISTORIC study. Activation of the GR in these cells will be assessed by translocation of the GR from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and by studying GR phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation and methylation in the presence and absence of glucocorticoids. The expression of GRa/GRß, HDAC2, and the activation of AP-1, NF-kB and CREB will be studied by western blotting. Signaling cascades will be studied by next generation sequencing.

"Briel, Matthias",NA,Departement Klinische Forschung / Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics CEB,Making clinical trials more affordable - systematic investigation of trial costs and tool development,2019,"Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are an essential method of evaluating health care interventions and a cornerstone for evidence-based health care. Their conduct, in particular for investigator-initiated RCTs, has long involved many practical challenges, challenges that have become increasingly complex and costly. Efforts to render RCTs more cost-effective are, therefore, urgently needed. Identifying lever-points for cost reductions requires knowledge of cost structures and cost drivers (e.g. recruitment duration, sample size, therapeutic area, number of trial sites). The medical literature, however, currently lacks detailed empirical data addressing costs and resource use of investigator-initiated RCTs as well as information about current practices of budget planning and cost monitoring, attitudes, needs, and preferences of trial investigators, trial support organizations (e.g. Clinical Trial Units), and funding agencies. Academic investigators usually depend on scarce financial resources; user-friendly and reliable tools to effectively limit costs of RCTs through optimized budget planning and cost monitoring during the conduct of an RCT are currently unavailable and sorely needed. We therefore propose three complementary projects using mixed-methods to render investigator-initiated RCTs more affordable and efficient through evidence-based budget planning, stakeholder consensus regarding relevant budget items, and the development of suitable tools. In Project A we will gather empirical resource use and cost data from 180 investigator-initiated RCTs in Switzerland, Germany, Canada, and the United Kingdom to investigate cost patterns, empirically identify major cost drivers and lever-points for cost savings, examine planned versus actual RCT costs, and explore heterogeneity of costs across medical fields and countries. Project B will consist of semi-structured interviews to explore current practices, attitudes, needs, and preferences of trial investigators, trial funders, and trial support organizations with respect to budget planning, funding acquisition for RCTs, managing costs during RCT conduct, and supporting tools in Switzerland. In Project C we will develop reliable and user-friendly budget calculation and cost monitoring tools for RCTs with stakeholder consensus based on systematically collected evidence from the literature/internet and informed by user needs and preferences (as elicited in Project B). We will formally user-test and evaluate the reliability and accuracy of developed tools using the generated database of empirical RCT cost data from Project A. The results of the proposed mixed-methods work will have immediate impact on the research practice of trial investigators, trial support organizations, and funders of RCTs in Switzerland and abroad. Given the increasing costs and complexity of RCTs, our project is timely and should shift the discussion from ""rough guesses"" to ""analysing transparent and valid data"" so that costs of clinical trials can be assessed, cost drivers identified, and costs effectively limited so that RCTs, critical to advancing clinical science, become more affordable.",NA,external_funding,Active,4514724,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,544,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Fortunately, there have been significant improvements in the last decade. Better treatment options guided by the discovery of targetable genomic alterations have been identified and improved patient's survival. However, personalized medicine with targeted therapeutics is suitable for less than 20-30% of Western patients. Landmark studies investigating the genomics of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have focused mainly on the most frequent types of NSCLC, namely lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). In contrast, rare but clinically relevant subtypes of NSCLCs, such as adenosquamous carcinoma (ASC) and pleomorphic carcinoma (PMC), have not yet been thoroughly investigated, despite affecting large patient numbers globally. The here proposed study draws upon the experiences and developments made in the previous SNF studies with LUAD (310030_138513) and LUSC (320030_162781), especially for the potential of whole-exome sequencing (WES) for the analysis of tumor evolution. Over the course of said studies, we have improved our bioinformatic pipeline and approaches from genomic analysis of targeted panel sequencing (310030_138513) to WES (320030_162781). Always in the context with our refined technology of multiparameter ploidy profiling (MPP), which allows separation of tumor population with high purity enabling the genomic analysis of complex tumor samples and tumors with low tumor cell content. The main aim of this study is to explore the molecular and genetic background of tumor heterogeneity and evolution in ASC and PMC in a comprehensive manner. For this purpose, we will analyze the morphological distinct tumor components of the two rare NSCLC subtypes ASC and PMC, which are defined by their distinct morphological heterogeneity and aggressive clinical behavior. We selected 20 patients with ASC and 20 patients with PMC from our pathology archive. In both cohorts, tumor regions will be separated by histology (adenosquamous carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma components in ASC; adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma and spindle and/or giant cell components in PMC) using macrodissection or the above-mentioned MPP approach in tumor specimens with low tumor cell proportion. DNA of all separated tumor regions will be tested for the presence of mutations, insertions- and deletions, copy number aberrations and mirrored allelic imbalances using WES. Further, epigenomic and transcriptomic profiles will be assessed using DNA methylation arrays and genome-wide gene expression arrays, respectively. This will allow us to elucidate the genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic background of morphologically different histologies in the two rare NSCLC subtypes, ASC and PMC that are defined by the striking intratumoral heterogeneity of their morphology. Importantly, we will be able to define to which extent each of the three 'Omic' profiles contribute to the morphological heterogeneity and to decipher the evolution of these tumors. This may not only provide new fundamental insights into the molecular mechanisms of morphological tumor heterogeneity in general but also pinpoint new therapeutic avenues in these NSCLC subtypes, which are known for their aggressive clinical behavior.

Yet, it is not well recognized that high pollen concentrations may increase respiratory and cardiovascular events, leading to mortality and excess hospitalizations. Moreover, combined exposure to pollen, air pollution and weather conditions could have synergistic effects, that alter the allergenicity of pollen - a research area which has been hardly explored.AimI aim to investigate how short-term exposure to pollen is related to mortality, hospitalization and allergic symptoms, both on its own and synergistically with air pollution and weather. Moreover, in light of increasing allergy prevalence, I aim to study how the relationship between pollen and health has developed over the study period, and which subpopulations might be most at risk. MethodsI will develop spatiotemporal exposure models of pollen for the years 2003-2022 based on a network of 14 pollen measurements stations in Switzerland. These maps will allow me to attribute individual exposure to pollen, air pollution and weather by location and by day, and will be used as the exposure metric for the health analyses. For the health endpoints, I will use large, real-world datasets without selection bias: individual cause-specific mortality is available from the Swiss National Cohort (2003-2018) and hospital admissions from the hospital admission database of the Federal Office of Statistics. Taking advantage of the efficient case-crossover study design, I will investigate the population effects of pollen on daily respiratory and cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization, accounting for air pollution and weather as time-varying confounders. I will investigate: trends in how pollen affected each outcome over the last 16-year study period; identify potential interactions with air pollution or weather; and explore the effect modifiers age, sex and urban/rural residence.To explore individual sensitivity, I will study repeated accounts of self-reported symptoms from the ""e-symptoms"" app, launched in 2012 by aha! Swiss Allergy Centre and CK-care. Using random forests machine learning techniques, I will analyze the user base's symptom severity reports in relation to actual prevalent pollen, air pollution and weather triggers, and the diagnosed allergies they indicate. The trained model will allow me to predict personalized symptom severity for future days based on pollen forecasts and provide personalized prevention recommendations and thus enhance quality of life for the allergic population. Ultimately, as a single user contributes more symptom reports, I will be able to gradually improve their personalized symptom prediction based on their personal sensitivity, which is derived from their previous reports. Data collection is already ongoing, and will continue throughout the study until 2022.SignificanceThis highly innovative project utilizes available nationwide health datasets and a systematic smartphone-based data collection method, to better understand the role of pollen in self-reported symptoms, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases at both personalized and population levels. This study will add substantially to the small body of scientific evidence that airborne pollen is adversely related to severe health effects such as mortality and hospitalizations.

Patients with this inborn disease suffer lifelong from erythroderma (erythema and scaling skin). Subsequently however, all patients start to develop pale spots of different dimension within the inflamed skin area, which look like healthy skin. All patients are carrier of a heterozygous variant in either the keratin (KRT)10 or KRT1 gene. These variants are insertions or deletions of some nucleotides resulting in a shifted reading frame (frameshift) and translation of an aberrant carboxy (C)-terminus. 54 distinct keratins (KRT) are known. They are intermediate filaments, which are responsible for mechanical cell stability in human epidermis. Within the cells of the epidermis (keratinocytes) KRT are localized in the cytoplasm. They heterodimerize and subsequently heteropolymerize to form intermediate filaments. In erythrodermic epidermis of IWC patients however, the mutant KRT and its assembly partner are aberrantly localized in the nucleus. The underlying nuclear import system is unknown. Once the phenotype reverts to a pale spot all local KRT are again correctly localized in the cytoplasm. DNA analyses of the pale spots revealed a loss of the mutant allele and its replacement by a second copy of the wildtype allele, so that the affected keratinocytes display a loss of heterozygosity (LOH). The underlying pathomechanism is not yet understood. Hence, the local, specific LOH allows the skin to revert to the normal phenotype. This mechanism could potentially be highly useful for treatment of other dominant skin conditions. The nuclear localization of aberrant KRT is probably the cause of the inflammation, as other keratins have been shown to be key switches of inflammation once localized in the nucleus. In addition, the type of inflammation produced by the pathologic KRT1/10 variants remains to be characterized on the cytokine and intra-cellular signalling level. We intend to explain the pathomechanism of IWC addressing questions regarding interactions of the aberrant KRT with other proteins and chromatin as well as its effects on epidermal and non-epidermal cells. We will test several hypotheses in vitro and in vivo, aiming in the identification of parts of the pathomechanism in IWC. Understanding the IWC-pathomechanism means increasing the knowledge about general intra- and intercellular signalling, skin inflammation and proliferation, as well as chromosomal rearrangements and LOH.

Consequently, PI3Ks promote cell growth, proliferation, migration and counteract apoptosis, and have been identified as valuable targets in oncology. Mechanistic, genetic and pharmacological data have associated specific class I PI3K isoforms with cancer, immunity and inflammation, allergy, metabolic control and cardiovascular disease.

PI3K? is a heterodimeric complex of the catalytic p110? subunit, and one adapter subunit, comprising of either p84 or p101. As we have demonstrated earlier, p84 and p101 operate non-redundantly, and the p84- and p101-PI3K? complexes produce distinguishable PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 submembrane pools with distinct cellular functions. Moreover, we have shown that p110 is phosphorylated and activated by protein kinase Cß (PKCß) in IgE-stimulated mast cells.Here we propose to investigate PI3K? adapter dependencies in mouse models for allergy, obesity, and loss of PI3Kd-induced (auto-) immunity. The approach builds on mouse models we have previously explored using p110? null mice. As PI3K? complexes occur in hematopoietic cells in different p84/p101 ratios, adapter protein contributions to specific cell responses are not well understood.The planned experiments aim to define cellular networks and cell types required in the above-mentioned disease states, and to explore if specific PI3K? complexes relay cell-specific responses. In allergy, FceRI-expressing mast cells express p84, in obesity macrophages with p84 and p101 contribute to insulin resistance, and an ill-defined cellular compartment modulates thermogenesis maintaining a lean phenotype in PI3K? mice. Lymphocytes seem dominated by p101, but also here non-cell autonomous processes influence lymphocyte development and the progression of autoimmunity.Moreover, sometimes controversial PI3K? interactions have been claimed to redefine anti-inflammatory PI3K? as a target in cancer. Novel approaches are proposed to validate and map current and novel PI3K? interactions at the membrane to further elucidate PI3K?-adapter protein function.",NA,external_funding,Active,4514738,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,548,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"Willitsch, Stefan",NA,Departement Chemie / Chemische Physik (Willitsch),Collisional and Half-Collisional Dynamics of Conformationally Selected Molecules,2019,"The reaction rates and dynamics of chemical reactions and molecular energy transfer are often influenced by the structure of the involved molecules. Even subtle changes of the molecular geometry can make significant differences in chemical reactivity. Both intramolecular and intermolecular processes need to be understood on the quantum level in molecular systems with well-defined geometries in order to establish a detailed understanding of structure- reactivity relationships. The present project aims at establishing a comprehensive characterisation of these relationships in selected model systems by studying both collisional and half-collisional reactions by pooling the expertise of the Korean and Swiss partners. Combined structural and quantum aspects of chemical reaction dynamics will be studied under precisely controlled conditions in the gas phase. State-of-the-art experimental techniques such as Stark deflection, double-resonance, stimulated-emission pumping and hole-burning will be employed in order to spatially or spectroscopically isolate specific conformational isomers of the molecules in the gas phase. This will enable the study of half-collisional reactions such as photodissociation, intramolecular tunnelling, and isomerization as well as state-selective full collisional reactions in a conformer-specific manner. Measurements of conformationally resolved spectra and reaction-rate constants will be complemented by frequency and/or time resolved velocity-map ion/electron imaging experiments to elucidate fine details of the reaction dynamics. The systems targeted in this study are hydroquinone, resorcinol and oxalyl chloride and their reactions with free radicals such as F, Cl and OH which have been selected for their prototypical character and experimental amenability. In addition to the bare conformationally selected molecules, investigations will also be performed with their conformationally selected clusters with water in order to study the effects of incipient solvatisation on the reactivity and dynamics. Moreover, vibrationally state-selected studies will be performed to gain insights into the interplay between mode- and structure-specific reactive effects. The experiments will be complemented by ab-initio and reactive molecular dynamics calculations to analyse and interpret the data. Spectroscopic characterization of conformers and their half-collisional dynamics will be studied at KAIST in Korea, whereas full collisional dynamics involving conformer-specific neutral-radical will be investigated at University of Basel in Switzerland. The partner groups constitute an ideal match to carry out the present research programme by sharing similar research interests, but contributing complementary scientific expertise, techniques and equipment. The project relies on harvesting the synergies between the groups through the exchange of knowledge, of experimental techniques and of data as well as through the joint training of PhD students and regular scientific visits of the involved personnel between Switzerland and Korea. By for the first time contrasting intra- with inter-molecular dynamics in selected geometry- selected model systems, we expect that the present project will yield new and valuable insights into structure-reactivity relationships in chemistry. We expect that the present results will not only be of immediate relevance for the advancement of molecular and chemical physics, but will also contribute to the general understanding of chemical reactivity and be of specific benefit to a wider range of disciplines such as synthetic chemistry and catalysis.",NA,external_funding,Active,4514841,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,549,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Cascade genetic screening is a sequential process of identifying and testing blood relatives of a known mutation carrier to determine if they also carry the pathogenic variant, in order to propose preventive and other clinical management options that reduce morbidity and mortality. However, according to Swiss and Korean privacy laws, individuals identified with the pathogenic variant have the sole responsibility to share information about test results and health implication to relatives. Empirical evidence suggests that up to 50% of biological relatives are unaware of relevant genetic information, suggesting that potential benefits of genetic testing are not communicated effectively. Thus, interventions designed to help probands effectively communicate with relatives are critical for better management of hereditary cancer risk. Technology could play a significant role in facilitating communication and genetic education within HBOC families.   Given the lack of well-developed digital health tools to assist individuals with genetic predisposition to cancer effectively communicate genetic information to their relatives, the study aims to develop a modern, scalable, mobile friendly digital health solution for Swiss and Korean HBOC families. The digital health solution will be based on the Family Gene Toolkit (FGT), a web-based intervention designed to enhance communication of genetic test results within HBOC families that has been successfully tested for acceptability, usability, and participant satisfaction.  The study will also expand an existing research infrastructure developed in Switzerland, to enable future collaborative projects between Switzerland and Korea in this field. The Specific Aims of the project are: 1) Develop a digital health solution to support the communication of cancer predisposition among HBOC families, based on linguistic and cultural adaptation methods of the Family Gene Toolkit for the Swiss and Korean population 2) Develop the K-CASCADE research infrastructure in Korea by expanding an existing research infrastructure developed by the CASCADE Consortium in Switzerland 3) Evaluate the efficacy of the aforementioned digital solution on psychological distress and communication of genetic test results, as well as knowledge of cancer genetics, coping, decision making and quality of life 4) Explore the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of the aforementioned digital solution   The content for the digital health solution will be based on the FGT with linguistic adaptation to Korean, German, French and Italian, and will be made available for web and mobile access. Aim 1 will be achieved through focus groups in each country to better identify cultural context with 20 -24 HBOC mutation carriers and relatives and 6-10 healthcare providers involved in genetic services (counseling and testing). For Aim 2, K-CASCADE, a Korean database of HBOC families (mutation carriers and relatives) will be created based on the Swiss CASCADE Consortium database, creating a lasting research infrastructure that will facilitate future collaboration, including the possibility to apply machine learning algorithms for prediction of breast and ovarian cancer risk. For Aim 3, feasibility and efficacy of the digital health solution against the comparison intervention will be assessed in a randomized trial, with a sample of 104 HBOC mutation carriers (52 in each study arm). Aim 4 will be achieved with survey and interview data collected from participating HBOC families and healthcare providers during all phases of the study. Dissemination strategies will also be generated to ensure sustainable use of the digital health solution. Adapting existing interventions, rather than developing new ones, takes advantage of previous valid experiences without duplicating efforts. Adaptation and implementation of culturally sensitive, digital health interventions that can facilitate communication processes within the family and enhance understanding of genetic cancer risk are extremely timely and relevant, given the expansion of genetic testing technology, the falling costs of genetic testing, and the increased pressure for integration of genetic knowledge in routine clinical care. The study would be one of the first resource-effective international research platforms to develop digital health solutions that can be scaled to large patient numbers and can be used in routine practice.","web-based intervention, hereditary breast/ovarian cancer, family communication, billateral collaboration, family-based cohort",external_funding,Active,4514845,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,550,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

L'humour et la poésie partagent certains traits formels et fonctionnels.

My team has dedicated time and effort into the circuit dissection of such functions with a special focus on the specific cell types and their related pathways involved in the generation of movement initiation and maintenance, fine motor skills precisely reaching and grasping, conditioned learning and anxiety. In this project we focus on two main lines:   1- ""Role of Zona Incerta subpopulations under anxiogenic and fearful states""  As the name implies, the Zona Incerta is a region shrouded with mystery. Interestingly, clinical studies have reported that deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ZI alleviates symptoms of movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease and tremor disorders. Additionally, ZI DBS resulted in lower measures of anxiety and depression (Burrows et al., 2012). This suggests a link between the ZI and these emotional states. Despite this interesting clinical observation, the role of the ZI in anxiety has not been investigated. We hypothesized that specific neuronal subpopulations in the ZI encode anxious states and propose a multi-level approach that will address the following questions:  What are the neuronal cell types expressed in the ZI? What is the input-output connectivity of each ZI neuronal cell population? How do ZI neurons respond to anxiogenic/fearful events?  This research proposal relies on the use of cutting edge technologies which are fully established and functional in our laboratory, including in situ fluorescent hybridization (FISH), anatomical mapping of specific cell types, in vitro patch clamp recordings, in vivo calcium imaging (Inscopix mini-endoscope) in freely behaving mice, motor-, fear-, and anxiety-related behavioral tasks and in vitro as well as in vivo optogenetic manipulations.   2- ""Input-specific synaptic plasticity underly reaching skills""  The Red Nucleus (RN) is required for limb control, specifically fine motor coordination. Our previous work reports unprecedented findings showing that Vglut2-expressing RN neurons undergo plastic changes to encode the optimization of fine movements (Rizzi et al., 2019). Here we propose a follow up study which will identify the excitatory inputs involved in the synaptic plastic modifications underlying the acquisition of the reaching movement. To do so we will address the following aims:  What are the monosynaptic inputs onto Vglut2- positive RN cells? How does each input neuron type encode information during learning in the reaching task? Which of these selective synapses undergo plastic changes during learning in the reaching task?

Changes in water availability and more intense drought events will have  significant impacts on the central European vegetation and on temperate Europeanforests in particular. Importantly, critical mechanisms that determine how changes in water availability and drought will impact the functioning of temperate European forests are poorly understood and not well represented in earth system models. Anticipating the consequences of a future climate for the functioning of temperate European forests is therefore difficult and hinders the design of mitigation options and future forest management plans.Most experiments that attempt to improve the mechanistic understanding of drought responses of terrestrial ecosystem have to date focused either on the experimental manipulation of grasslands or on investigations with tree seedlings or saplings. Although forests play an essential role for the delivery of ecosystem goods and services, very few experiments exist in established temperate European forests that mechanistically investigate the responses of mature trees and forest to changes in water availability or drought. To close this critical research gap, it is the goal of this proposal to establish an experimental research platform in a species rich and mature temperate forest in Switzerland. This experimental platform will provide the  opportunity over the next two decades to host research projects addressing some of the most important unresolved questions with respect to tree and forests responses to changes in the precipitation regime and drought. Specifically, these projects will address the long-term acclimation potential of individual species or entire forests to precipitation changes, physiological and biogeochemical thresholds and tipping pointsduring drought, and recovery processes during and after extended drought events.The experimental research platform that we seek to establish will combine a unique infrastructure that we request with this proposal. This infrastructure will include (i) a canopy crane that will allow scientific investigations in the canopy of more than 250 mature trees, (ii) six mobile roofs that will be installed 2.5 m above the ground and will cover a total area of 3398 m2 for the manipulation of precipitation inputs into theforest, and (iii) state of the art scientific instrumentation.","forest drought, drought, climate change, acclimation potential",external_funding,Completed,4516426,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,555,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE

Despite extensive research on new compounds, there have been no major breakthroughs in the pharmacological treatment of psychotic disorders in more than 20 years. Only about 40% of patients have a good symptomatic outcome; moreover, rates of functional recovery are as low as 13.5% and have not improved over the past decades despite the introduction of several new antipsychotics. Psychological treatments have shown promise in improving outcomes. However, their dissemination is limited by applicability and motivation/adherence issues. In response to these limitations, several 'new wave' psychological treatments have adopted a low-threshold approach by addressing specific factors contributing to the emergence and maintenance of circumscribed symptom clusters. A prominent example is metacognitive training, which addresses reasoning biases associated with the emergence and maintenance of delusions. Although metacognitive training has shown good efficacy in treating delusions and positive symptoms in the research setting, its effectiveness is dependent on treatment adherence, which constitutes a major challenge in patients with psychotic disorders. The present project aims to address this treatment gap by using a video game ('Choice maze') specifically developed to function as a delivery method for metacognitive training in these patients. The efficacy of the video game will be assessed in 36 patients with psychotic disorders with a randomized, rater-blind, controlled design. The primary outcome is delusion severity, while secondary outcomes include measures of reasoning biases as well as usability, acceptability and adherence. Therapeutic gaming is an exciting and rapidly growing research field that takes advantage of advances in psychological theory and computer technology, with great innovation potential.

Today, almost 250 years later, one can observe a normatively loaded normality. It almost seems as if the source of normativity is statistical voluntarism, in which obligation derives from authoritative statistics which articulate an ought for the individual. However, any claim about what ought to be, which is exclusively based on descriptive premises (e.g. statistical statements) falls victim to the is-ought problem articulated by David Hume. A statistical statement is, in the first place, a descriptive statement and, thus, a descriptive premise about what something is, which standalone does not vindicate a normative conclusion. In flexible normalism, today's dominant societal strategy of how normalism unfolds within a society, norms are being calculated ex post based on statistical data and an individual may or may not adjust to these norms. Searching for the normal and orientation, the individual does not face pre-defined norms, but is confronted with crystallized realms of normality. This means that normality is constantly changing. May norms have been developed in a flexible normalistic way, once established they still cause a suction effect, which, at the individual level, leads to internalization of these norms and fear of denormalization, and, at the societal level, to homogenization and normalization - the time of normalism has arrived. Flexible normalism has its dangers. Not being considered as normal may lead to stigmatization, social exclusion, and pathologization as well as to real pathologies on the part of the individual. Thus, the proposed research project aims to (a) promote awareness for the dangers of tying statistics and normativity, and (b) empower individuals to overcome this nexus of statistics and normativity. The study will, first, make people think about the term ""normal"", about its (mis)use, and about potential dangers, and, second, shed light on the meaning of the term ""normal"" in people's everyday language and on the reasons for its use. Ultimately, the study aims to demonstrate the following choice between Scylla and Charybdis: the term ""normal"" either refers to all existing human properties and, therefore, becomes meaningless, or it exclusively refers to a subset of human properties and, thereby, excludes other properties from being normal and abets social exclusion, stigmatization, and normalism.

Some have suggested that care should mimic intuitive human responses, or reflect societal preferences on who should be prioritised in such incidents. But three significant lacunae exist in this area of research. First, existing research has neglected potentially relevant data types that could also be used as inputs for decisions about how smart cars should react in crash scenarios. Second, the research that has been conducted has focused on assessing the intuitive moral reactions of members of the public, rather than considered reflective responses. The fact that people react instinctively while driving a care does not mean that their decisions are sound, or that such decisions should be used as a model for ethical decision making by computers that can process thousands more types of relevant input.  Finally, no such research on the ethics of autonomous vehicles has been conducted in Switzerland, so the attitudes and subjective moral views of Swiss citizens have not yet been captured at either the shallow or any deeper level.

Disinformation is by no means a recent problem. The fight for domination of information channels in order to influence the public has always been an integral characteristic of any power struggle. Apart from speed, there are two aspects which are new today: the growing importance of images in relation to the written form, and the democratization of image processing via photoshop and other tools. The Humanities, in particular History, for ages self-sufficient with books, paper and pencils, must develop new and innovative methods of visual analysis and communication based on teamwork and technology.  This proposal suggests to expand the visual expertise of history by bringing together academic researchers with film professionals in a project which focuses on an area unnoticed so far: ""Fake history"" is created by authoritarian regimes and ideologies and taught to the youth in order to secure their legitimacy. At home, these children listen to their parents' and grandparents' stories, which more often than not differ vastly from what they hear at school. These stories often contain suppressed memories of mass violence. In the last few decades, video film has been used as an outlet to negotiate such memories in societies inflicted by state repression. Convinced of the profound relevance of these films and their directors' knowhow, this project aims at preparing the ground for a large research project which uses a comparative approach to analyze memories of state violence and reconciliation attempts from conflict zones at the European periphery communicated by film.

"Shields, Brendan",NA,NA,Nuclear assisted spin to charge conversion for nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance,2019,"Nuclear magnetic resonance of nanoscale sample volumes would radically revolutionize diverse fields ranging from medicine to condensed matter. Over the course of the past decade, the development of solid state quantum sensors has been steadily marching towards this goal. In this project, we propose a path toward dramatic improvement in magnetic sensitivity for a leading nanoscale solid-state sensor, the nitrogen vacancy (NV) centre in diamond. The NV is an atomic scale defect in the diamond lattice having a single electron spin degree of freedom. Crucially, the electron spin can be initialized and read out by application of laser light and fluorescence contrast detection, a process known as optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR). Furthermore, the electron spin is coherently coupled to nearby nuclear spins including the nuclear spin of the host nitrogen atom. A high-precision measurement of the NV electron spin is the key enabling technology for nanoscale sensing with this system. We propose to combine two key techniques for electron spin readout, namely nuclear assisted repetitive readout (NRR) and spin-to-charge conversion (SCC). The SCC method converts the spin state to the robust charge degree of freedom, which eliminates the detrimental effects of photon shot noise, yielding up to an order of magnitude signal-to-noise (SNR) enhancement over the standard fluorescence contrast readout for a single readout cycle. Meanwhile, the NRR method stores the electron spin state in a long-lived nuclear spin, allowing for hundreds of readout cycles.However, the combination of SCC with NRR to date has been hampered by technical complexity as well as by the high overhead time of the SCC method (typically on the order of milliseconds). The primary technical goal of this proposal is therefore to dramatically reduce the SCC overhead time to ~3 microseconds through a combination of photonic engineering and adaptive measurement protocols. This will enable the combination of SCC with NRR, leading to an order of magnitude improvement in SNR, and boosting the corresponding sensitivity of NV-based nanoscale NMR techniques.","quantum information, nitrogen vacancy center, quantum sensing, nuclear magnetic resonance, nanoscale magnetometry, quantum metrology",external_funding,Completed,4516849,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,560,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Although pharmacological treatment with methylphenidate (MPH) reduces these deficits, it does not normalize the recipients in the long-term. Evidence, albeit limited, suggests that exercise may enhance the cognitive benefits of pharmacological treatment. Due to a unique combination of physical exertion, cognitive demands and promotion of discipline, martial arts particularly have the potential to be an effective additional component of ADHD therapy. However, possible benefits of martial arts have not yet been examined in children with ADHD.Purpose: The study aims to examine the effects of a 12-week judo training program on executive function and behavioral symptoms in children with ADHD. Possible benefits are investigated on a neurocognitive level to gain insights on the subtle processes that may contribute to exercise-induced enhancements within this cognitive domain. Additionally, the association between changes in neurophysiological indices of executive function and gains in motor skills as well as aerobic fitness are examined. Method: The study utilizes a randomized-controlled design, in which 56 children with ADHD are allocated to a martial arts group or a (wait-list) control group in a 1:1 ratio. Whereas the control group is encouraged to maintain their usual sports participation, a 12-week martial arts program with two 60-min sessions per week is prescribed to the martial arts group. Prior to and after the intervention period, computer-based versions of the Go/NoGo task and the Change Detection task are administered. Simultaneously, event-related brain potentials (ERP) related to inhibitory processing (P300 elicited from the Go/NoGo task) and working memory capacity (CDA elicited from the Change Detection task) are recorded via electroencephalography. Participants' behavioral symptoms, aerobic fitness and motor skills are also measured at both measurement time points. Moreover, intelligence, pubertal status, socioeconomic status and general physical activity levels are assessed as potential confounders. Practical relevance: The findings are expected to reveal novel insights into the effects of judo on executive function in children with ADHD undergoing treatment with methylphenidate. In the long-term, these insights may be used to further develop and evaluate this specific exercise type as additional treatment component.",NA,external_funding,Active,4604619,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,561,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Accordingly, injury to the rotator cuff greatly affects joint function and limits the patients' activities. Rotator cuff tears are a common shoulder injury that sometimes remain undiagnosed because of limited symptoms. However, altered shoulder biomechanics because of injury - even when only subtle - can lead to secondary damage and degeneration including tendinopathy or osteoarthritis. Because of the overlying soft tissue, measuring shoulder biomechanics is complex. Motion of the healthy shoulder primarily comprises rotation with very small to no translation because of stabilization through muscle activity and is affected by muscle cross sectional area (MCSA) and shoulder anatomy including the critical shoulder angle (CSA) and glenoid inclination (GI). Although often clinically observed, inconclusive changes in shoulder translation have been reported in patients with rotator cuff tear. However, to date it is unknown how additional handheld weight similar to situations during daily, occupational or recreational activities affects glenohumeral translation in patients with rotator cuff tear. Based on previous methods for assessing glenohumeral translation, we have developed an in vivo, simulation and ex vivo experimental framework for systematically modulating additional weight during a loading shoulder abduction test that we propose to employ in this study. This framework allows us to assess the dose-response relationship between additional weight and glenohumeral translation termed load-induced glenohumeral translation (liTr). We will address the following specific aims in in vivo, simulation and ex vivo experiments: understanding the biological variation in liTr; understanding the influence of disease pathology on liTr; understanding the potential compensation of rotator cuff tear by muscle activation and muscle size; and understanding the association of liTr and patient outcomes. Patients with rotator cuff tears and asymptomatic persons with similar age and sex distribution will be clinically assessed and complete a loading shoulder abduction test while collecting single plane fluoroscopy images. The same test will be repeated while 3-dimensional (3D) motion data and electromyographic data is collected. In the motion analysis test and in the fluoroscopy test, handheld weight will be applied. LiTr will be calculated as the slope of a regression of the negative distance of the glenohumeral centre of rotation (GHJC) to the acromion and studied in relation to patient's functional scores, MCSA, tear size and type, and the CSA and GI. Moreover, we will extent a previously developed shoulder simulator to integrate glenoid specimen, anterior and posterior aspects of the deltoid muscle and facilitate simulation of individual tendon rupture. Subsequently, we will use this shoulder simulator in simulation and ex vivo experiments to systematically study the effect of tear size and type, CSA and GI in sawbones and human cadaveric specimen. Finally, we will compare results of in vivo, simulation and ex vivo experiments and formulate specific recommendation for clinic and rehabilitation. This study can be considered as proof-of-concept of a potential diagnostic test (loading shoulder abduction test) for glenohumeral translation and will provide first evidence of a dose-response relationship between additional weight and glenohumeral translation. Moreover, the simulation and ex vivo experiments using a shoulder simulator allow the systematic investigation of mechanical compensation for injury to one or more rotator cuff muscles.

While 98% of patients survive 5 years or more after diagnosis of a localized (confined to the primary site) breast cancer, this number drops to 15-25% if the cancer has metastasized to distant organs. Curing metastatic breast cancer clearly represents an unmet medical need. Yet, the cellular and biochemical mechanisms orchestrating the steps leading to drug resistant metastases remain largely unknown. Their identification, which is the overarching goal of this application, should enhance the development of targeted therapies for this presently incurable disease.A thorough understanding of cellular pathways involved in tumor initiation, metastasis, and resistance to therapy is the appropriate basis to tailor therapy to the patient. Indeed, several inhibitors of the most common oncogenic pathways have been tested in preclinical models and are already included in the care of patients. Despite the specificity of many of these approaches, the clinical translation of most single therapies has been sub-optimal; they were either ineffective or transiently effective with subsequent emergence of resistance. Therefore, the mechanisms of limited therapeutic responses must be carefully assessed in order to better tailor the therapy to each cancer patient and to rationally design combinations of therapies. The overarching goals of this proposal are to assess the molecular mechanisms underlying normal and neoplastic mammary stem cells, progression to metastasis and resistance to therapy.Our preliminary data using the PiggyBac (PB) transposon insertional mutagenesis approach has revealed that this system increases self-renewal of normal and neoplastic mammary stem cells and metastasis, and results in resistance to therapy. Transposon integration sites in these preclinical models were revealed by splinkerette PCR and by next-generation sequencing, and potential new candidate regulators of self-renewal and resistance to therapy have been identified.

"Tschopp, Patrick",NA,Departement Umweltwissenschaften / Regulatory Evolution (Tschopp),Elucidating the gene regulatory logic of convergent cell fate specification in the developing vertebrate skeleton,2019,"Cell fate specification - that is, how distinct cell types arise from a pool of precursor cells - is one of the hallmarks of embryonic development. During this process, a genome common to all cells of an organism is differentially interpreted at the gene regulatory level, to result in individualized cellular phenotypes. So far, most studies have focused on the specification of different cell types from a single progenitor pool. However, notable exceptions exist to this trajectory, such as in the vertebrate skeleton that, depending on anatomical location, develops from three distinct progenitor populations (neural crest, somitic and lateral plate mesoderm). Despite this diversity in embryonic origins and thesurrounding tissue environments, these three progenitor populations converge phenotypically to give rise to functionally equivalent skeletal cell types. With the current project, we aim to define the gene regulatory logic underlying such cell fate convergence. Specifically, we will decode how transcriptional networks assimilate differences in progenitor transcriptomes and tissue niches to produce analogous cell types from distinct embryonic sources. Based on preliminary data from our lab, I hypothesize that progenitor-specific transcription factor profiles, resulting from cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic differences in their embryonic origins, are integrated at the cis-regulatory level, via lineage-specific enhancer elements, to result in the transcriptional and phenotypic convergence of the three skeletal precursor pools. To functionally test these hypotheses, I propose to combine state-of-the-art functional genomics at single cell- and lineage-resolution with experimental embryology and targeted CRISPR/Cas9-genome modifications. Capitalizing on the superior temporal control in avian embryos, their ability to sustain transplantation experiments, and our expertise in developmental biology, molecular genetics and transcriptome analyses, we will:   Define, at single cell- and lineage-resolution, the transcriptome and chromatin dynamics of the three progenitor pools, as they converge towards a common skeletal cell fate   Elucidate the interplay of cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic parameters in this gene regulatory convergence using quail-chick grafts followed by single-cell RNA-sequencing and chromatin accessibility profiling   Functionally validate candidate regulatory factors underlying this convergence in vivo, using the CRISPR/Cas9system in a lineage-specific manner in chicken embryos   Collectively, our work will delineate the gene regulatory logic instructing the transcriptional and phenotypic convergence towards a common skeletal cell fate, across three distinct embryonic progenitor pools.

"Milan, Giulia",NA,Departement Biozentrum,Role of the AKT-mTORC1 pathway in muscle proteostasis,2019,"Maintaining proteostasis is crucial for muscle function and mass. Muscle wasting is a hallmark of many diseases, including sarcopenia (age-driven muscle loss), cachexia (as a secondary consequence of cancer or AIDS) and muscular dystrophies. The IGF/insulin-Akt-mTORC1-FoxO pathway plays a central role in proteostasis. During catabolic conditions, FoxO transcription factors drive muscle atrophy by increasing the expression of key molecules of the two major proteolytic systems, the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and the autophagy-lysosome system (ALS). During anabolic conditions, growth factors or insulin activate mammalian (or mechanistic) target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Several loss-of-function studies support the importance of mTORC1-driven protein synthesis for muscle growth (Bentzinger et al., 2008; Castets et al., 2013; Risson et al., 2009) However, mice in which mTORC1 is constantly active in skeletal muscle by genetic depletion of its inhibitor TSC1 (TSCmKO mice), lose muscle mass despite increased protein synthesis (Bentzinger et al., 2013a). These results provide strong evidence against the simple view that mTORC1 is responsible for muscle anabolism and FoxOs for muscle catabolism. The molecular mechanisms responsible are not known. In my postdoctoral work, in collaboration with a PhD student of the Rüegg laboratory, I have collected data that strongly indicate that activation of mTORC1 concomitantly increases proteasomal degradation. For example: expression of the two E3 ligases Atrogin1 and MuRF1 is increased; expression of several proteasome subunits (PSM) and proteasome activity itself also increase. All these effects are blunted by short-term treatment with the mTORC1-inhibitor rapamycin. Importantly, the increase in PSM is also seen in adult iTSCmKO mice after the depletion of TSC1 for only 21 days. Next, we identified nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 1 (Nfe2l1 or Nrf1) as a candidate to mediate mTORC1-driven proteasome enrichment. To firmly establish this novel mechanism, we now propose a set of experiments to (1) measure UPS efficiency directly in skeletal muscle fibers in vivo in TSCmKO mice, to (2) determine the role of Nrf1 in mTORC1-driven protein degradation and (3) to determine the contribution of the mTORC1-Nrf1-PSM axis in a mouse model of muscle growth. These experiments will provide essential information on the role of mTORC1 in regulating muscle proteostasis. Such information may allow to develop new therapeutic strategies that aim at slowing-down muscle wasting.    ","skeletal muscle, proteostasis, Akt, mTORC1, FoxO, NRF1, Proteasome",external_funding,Completed,4522416,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,565,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

In particular, thermal management in nano-electronics and other nano-systems has become the bottleneck for device scaling and performances in electronics. Due to the wavelengths and mean free paths of phonons, thermal transport at the nanoscale can be significantly different from thermal transport at the macro scale. Furthermore, the progress in nanofabrication enables the design and fabrication of nanostructures that can control heat transport by means of interference effects, achieving coherent phonon transport, and allowing exciting experiments (see e.g. Nature 503, 209 (2013)).

But is it able to encode memories of early-life experiences? Since most of us don't remember what happened during the first years of our lives, for a long time this question has been open to debate. Recent evidence suggests that, even if we cannot recall them, early-life memories are encoded in the developing hippocampus, persist in a silent state into adulthood, and can affect the acquisition of new information later in life. We know very little about how the infant brain encodes early-life memories, despite the fact that our earliest experiences can stick with us and influence our behaviour as adults. How can the infant hippocampus produce long-lasting memory traces when its circuits are not yet mature? Why can't we remember early-life memories?

"Pieters, Jean",NA,Departement Biozentrum / Biochemistry (Pieters),Development of compounds for the induction of tolerance following heart transplantation,2020,"Heart failure is a life-threatening disease, with an estimated 25 million people being currently affected worldwide. While many factors can contribute to heart failure, one of the best treatment options for many of these would be transplantation of a healthy heart. Unfortunately, other than in the case of an identical twin, all donor hearts suffer from mismatching, resulting in high rejection rates. Moreover, even after receiving an appropriately-matched donor heart, recipients often require life-long immunosuppression. This makes them highly susceptible to opportunistic infections and spontaneous cancers. A therapy allowing mismatched heart transplantations without the need for overt immunosuppression is currently not available. Graft rejection following transplantation is mainly caused by activation of a subset of immune cells, called T cells. These cells recognize a donor organ as foreign, and therefore initiate an immune response against the graft, thereby effectively rejecting the transplanted organ. We have recently identified a hitherto unknown T cell-dependent pathway that mediates suppression of rejection following heart transplantation involving an immune cell-specific protein termed coronin 1. In recently published work (Immunity, 2019), we found that coronin 1 deletion resulted in long-term acceptance of mismatched heart allografts, in the absence of any other immunosuppressive therapy. The goal of the proposed project is to develop inhibitors of the coronin 1-dependent pathway, that may be useful for the prevention of rejection following heart allo-transplantation.

Secondly, it will allow the treatment of end-stage heart failure patients having undergone allotransplantation to avoid graft rejection.

More exactly, both enzymes are very important in maintaining the androgen-glucocorticoid balance. Thus, any undesired interaction (inhibition) by small molecules (e.g. drugs, cosmetics, food additives, natural compounds) would result in altered activity of the enzymes and potentially lead to disruption of the steroid homeostasis. Increased levels of glucocorticoids may severely affect human health in terms of increased risk for development of metabolic diseases, including diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or non-alcoholic steatohepatosis (NASH) [1-3]. The main goal of this project proposal is to develop in silico predictive models for screening of small molecules in order to rapidly and reliably identify their undesired interaction with the two enzymes. The project requests one year funding for a PhD student who will get training and subsequently apply various state-of-the-art modeling techniques like molecular docking, pose scoring, homology modeling, molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate enzyme-ligand interactions at the atomic level in silico as well as establish experimental activity assays for initial testing and validation of screening hits. The modelling information together with the enzyme activity data will allow defining structure-activity-relationships for the two enzymes. 1.

Therefore, it is vital to analyse drivers for the supply of low-energy-consuming properties; e.g., buildings with Minergie labels. Our 2019 WWZ-FV project has focused on a price-oriented driver; namely rent premiums linked to Minergie labels. Using data of 370,000 properties (12,500 are Minergie labelled), we found a 3-5% rent premium for residential real estate in Switzerland which is attributable to the label itself. Due to the (very) large dataset with a richer set of property features we compiled, our findings are novel and far more reliable than those of existing studies that attempted similar estimation. Yet, from property investors' perspective, identifying opportunities for higher rental income from Minergie buildings is only one aspect of their investment decisions. For them, the real question is if investments in energy efficient buildings (incl. renovations &amp; retrofits) pay off; i.e., profitability of the investment. Thus, we must consider the extra building costs that arise from upgrading energy efficiency. Furthermore, investment decisions depend also on investors' knowledge or perceptions about profitability. Despite the criticality of profitability for property investors, the only type of profitability considered in empirical literatures is a vacancy rate. After all, a building with an eco label that lacks tenants brings no profit. However, the Swiss residential rental market exhibits close to 100% occupancy. Instead, the real costs incurred by green building investments are more salient factors of profitability in our context. Despite the seeming conceptual clarity of integrating costs and assessing profitability, it is anything else than trivial to integrate upfront investments (e.g., isolation, ventilation, solar PV, and non-fossil-fuel heating systems) as well as to calculate the annual (periodic) cost difference between operating a green versus a non-labelled property. Moreover, even if profitability can be measured and is known, there are some more crucial empirical questions to be answered: (1) if investors are aware of these facts (knowledge/perceived costs), and (2) if their investment decisions depend only on ""economic benefits"" or also on factors like ""sustainability branding"" supported by certificates. Hence, investigating the effect of both actual and investors' perceived profitability on the respective decision-making regarding green buildings is a logical next step following from our previous rent premium analyses. In other words, to understand the supply-side of sustainable real estate, we draw on our latest findings on the market implications of eco labelling and now ask investors' decision-oriented research questions: RQ1: What are best estimates for the upfront and periodic costs of operating green buildings? / RQ2: How do the rent premiums for Minergie labels translate to investors' effective profitability? / RQ3: Do investors' knowledge about rent premiums, costs, and profitability in the Swiss real estate market diverge from the actual measures?

According to regulations, all chemicals that may come to contact with humans have to be fully characterised, including information about their possible harmful effects. Such a detailed characterisation is not only resource intensive, but also results in extensive animal testing.Fortunately, in silico methods offer a cost-effective and ethical alternative. Ever increasing computational power in combination with the latest knowledge from multiple disciplines allow us to perform virtual experiments by means of computer simulation. Thus, we can learn about the nature of the chemical compound without need to have it physically synthesized and tested on animals. This means, that the extent of animal testing can be effectively reduced - it is performed only using the safest, computationally pre-evaluated compounds. Increased expected safety translates to animal testing reduced to inevitable minimum required for the regulatory approval.The goal of this grant proposal is to develop and maintain a modular in silico screeningplatform which could be used to effectively identify possible harmful interference ofchemicals with human proteins termed ""anti-targets"", as any interaction with them isundesired.

These methods have enabled new insights into the microscopic mechanisms, the quantum nature and the detailed dynamics of chemical processes which were not accessible before. By combining trapped, sympathetically cooled molecular ions with electrostatically deflected molec- ular beams, we have recently established a new experimental approach for studying reactive collisions of trapped molecular ions with state- and conformationally controlled neutral molecules. While we have so far achieved state, collision-energy and conformational control for the neutral reactants using the elec- trostatic deflection technique, the quantum state and conformation of the ionic co-reactant has not been specified in our previous experiments. To achieve a comprehensive control over a reactive process by predetermining its most important dynamical parameters, it is necessary to specify the quantum state and conformation of both reactants. In the present grant application, we propose to additionally generate polyatomic molecular ions in the vibrational ground state of specific conformational isomers in order to realise a fully vibrationally, conformationally and collision-energy-controlled ion-molecule reaction experiment for the first time. This will be achieved by preparing the ions using conformer-selective pho- toionisation techniques in combination with sympathetic cooling of their translational motion in an ion trap. Our new methodology will be applied to study conformationally and state-specific dynamics in a range of pertinent model systems including the reactions of rotationally state-selected water molecules and of conformationally selected 3-aminophenol molecules with conformationally selected phenylala- nine and 3-aminophenol ions.

Omics technologies are increasingly applied in these projects in order to gain detailed insights into biomolecular processes involved during homeostasis, regulation and perturbation of biological systems. Although genomics provides useful information on the genetic composition of a cell or organism, it is often insufficient to explain the observed biological phenotypes. These questions need to be answered by studying the protein complement (proteome) and cellular signalling by analysing post-translational modifications like phosphorylation (phosphoproteome). As outlined in this proposal, the different projects aim at a better understanding of complex processes involved in initiation and progression of diseases, including bacterial vaccination, malaria, cancer and muscle diseases, using proteomics data. Specifically, the following five projects of the proposal are described: Project 1 attempts to establish molecular mechanisms mediating responsiveness to targeted cancer therapy by generating proteome and phosphoproteome maps from serial biopsies of hepatocellular carcinoma patients (HCC) before and during drug treatment. We then take an 'multi-omics' approach to find molecular patterns predictive for treatment success. Project 2 focuses on the discovery of evasive signaling pathways in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by quantitative proteome and phosphoproteome comparisons of patient-derived tumor organoids after Sorafenib treatment at different time points. Project 3 employs data-independent proteomics to define cellular protein concentrations of Staphylococcus aureus proteins in patient abscesses and lung secretions. We will then use a reverse translational approach to find key components for urgently needed protective vaccines. Projects 4 intends to gain novel important insights into the complex regulation of the biological program of muscle adaptation to exercise by integrating proteome, signaling and protein-protein interaction data obtained from LC-MS analyses. Project 5 will employ targeted proteomics to identify components of the molecular machinery that regulates singular gene choice, an intriguing transcriptional control mechanism that facilitates antigenic variation and immune evasion of malaria parasites.  The proposed projects pose extremely challenging demands on protein sample analysis in terms of sensitivity, precision and throughput. Like in all clinical studies, due to the high interpatient variability, high sample numbers are required to achieve sufficient statistical power for confident target discovery and validation. Moreover, many proteins and modifications of interest are low abundant and very challenging to quantify consistently with high precision across large sample batches. After extensive evaluation, we found the Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer to be the only instrument on the market to have sufficient speed and sensitivity to meet these high analytical requirements. In particular, its compatibility with data-independent workflows and new on-the-fly acquisition software allows unprecedented proteome coverage in discovery and the highest sensitivity and throughput for targeted MS experiments.  We are convinced that the new Q Exactive HF-X is the instrument of choice to fullfil the requirements of the projects listed above, and many more to come in the future.","Mass spectrometry, hepatocellular carcinoma, proteomics, signalling pathways, infection biology, muscle training",external_funding,Completed,4516420,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,581,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

However, nanostructured materials in general and nanocrystals (NCs) in particular present a challenging problem: their structure is difficult to analyze with conventional techniques. Whereas powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) is very powerful for micron-sized crystals, extreme peak broadening precludes the accurate analysis of nanomaterials. As a consequence, structure-function relationships are hard to establish. Recently, a new technique has emerged, X-ray Pair Distribution Function (PDF) analysis, which allows to accurately model nanostructured materials. This requires a specialized diffractometer with high energy X-rays and a sensitive detection system. Many Swiss research groups are involved in nanostructured materials, including the main applicant, who was recently appointed as an assistant professor in nanomaterials with a research program featuring the synthesis and characterization of ceramic NCs. However, Switzerland does not yet have a PDF diffractometer available, hampering Swiss nanoscience. Therefore, we request here a PDF diffractometer with a silver source that yields the highest data quality possible for a lab diffractometer within a reasonable time (6 hours per sample). With the requested diffractometer the main applicant will pursue several projects, both fundamental and applied. In the first three projects, the PDF method will be further improved by designing new PDF sample preparation techniques for colloidal NCs (increasing signal-to-noise and removing background scattering), implementing advanced modelling and integrating PDF with other analytical techniques.  This will greatly advance the use of lab source PDF diffractometers and establish PDF as a standard technique for NCs. In the second triad of projects, the main applicant will use PDF to support synthetic projects where the chemistry of (doped) metal oxide NCs is developed for bio-imaging applications and applied to shelling semiconductors NCs for solid state lighting applications.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a joint disease that affects the whole joint resulting in severe articular cartilage degeneration with a prevalence worldwide of more than 10%. Although the molecular mechanisms that trigger the pathological changes in OA are largely unknown, the ability of chondrocytes to respond to load is believed to play a critical role in maintaining healthy tissue and in the initiation of OA. Different modes of ambulation have resulted in increases of specific blood markers, and immobilization during bed-rest lead to reductions in the same blood markers. However, the dose-response relationship between ambulatory load and mechanosensitive blood markers, its biological variation in healthy persons and in patients with a high risk of developing OA (e.g. with increasing age or after joint injury), and its relevance for cartilage degeneration are unknown. Based on reported differences in the magnitude of load-induced changes in blood markers of articular cartilage depending on the type of physical activity, we have previously tested an experimental framework of a systematic and controlled modulation of weight bearing during a walking stress test that we propose to employ in this study. We will address the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Investigate the in vivo dose-response relationship between ambulatory load and mechanosensitive blood markers of articular cartilage using controlled weight bearing during a walking stress test and age, tissue status and the presence of inflammation as experimental paradigms.Specific Aim 2: Investigate the prognostic ability of the individual in vivo dose-response relationship between ambulatory load and mechanosensitive blood markers of articular cartilage for articular cartilage degeneration.

MDD and obesity are highly comorbid, the ""metabolic"" (obese) subtype of MDD affects about one third of all individuals with MDD. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop better preventive and therapeutic strategies, which may include specific dietary measures. Preclinical studies show that a diet low in carbohydrates (low-carb), effective in obesity and associated metabolic disorders, may be beneficial also in MDD. However, no clinical trials on the role of low-carb diet in MDD have been performed to date. Furthermore, while clinical data on the effects of a low-carb diet in obese and diabetic patients is available, the underlying mechanisms were not yet studied. Recent data suggest a key role of factors acting that may act synergistically: i) gut microbiota, ii) neuroplasticity and iii) neuroinflammation in both obesity and MDD, but their role in ""metabolic"" vs. ""lean"" (non-obese) MDD is unclear. Exciting clinical and preclinical results suggest that obesity and even MDD-like features can be ""transferred"" from humans to humans or rodents by fecal material transplantation (FMT). Mice deficient for the key neuroplasticity, MDD-associated marker brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) display are susceptible to both stress/depression-like behavior and obesity (""vulnerability""). Conversely, mice lacking the microglial fractalkine receptor CX3CR1, a main modulator of neuroinflammation, are resistant to both stress and obesity, when exposed to fat-enriched diet (""resilience""). However, the mechanistic interplay between these factors and their specific contribution to each disorder are not yet understood. To clarify these aspects we aim: a) to evaluate the therapeutic potential of dietary microbiome-influencing interventions (low-carb diet) on disease-associated parameters (psychometry, brain network activity, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal - hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, plasma BDNF/fractalkine levels, cytokines, gut microbiota composition, leaky gut and metabolic markers, metabolomics) in individuals suffering from MDD with or without obesity, towards better nosology of disease subtypes based on mechanisms and validation of possible new biomarkers (plasma BDNF/fractalkine, neuroimaging parameters); b) to assess molecular determinants of their effect in selected mouse models with deficiency of BDNF or CX3CR1; c) to clarify the contribution of changes in gut microbiota composition to the psychiatric/metabolic pathology by fecal material transplantation (FMT) of samples from patients with MDD, obesity or ""metabolic"" MDD, to the mouse lines upon microbiome depletion. The analysis in rodents will comprise similar approaches as in humans, together with investigations at cellular level regarding changes in the function of microglia, neurogenesis in MDD/obesity-relevant brain regions (hypothalamus, hippocampus) and inflammation in visceral adipose tissue, which cannot be performed in living humans. In all paradigms, we seek to unravel relevant gender-specific effects.

The simulations carried out by French partners will be cross-compared with experimental measurements in a variety of B-field angle and magnitude (0-3.5 T) configurations, in various devices hosted by the three project's partners. In addition, dedicated simulations will directly aim at refining the interpretation of probe measurements, which will be further cross-validated with optical measurements. Therefore, the physics of diagnostics has a central place in the SHEAR project.   The SHEAR work program is organized into 5 inter-related scientific work packages (WP) based on coherent theoretical, modelling and experimental approaches. The first WP aims principally at developing accurate interpretation models for probe measurements in magnetized RF plasmas. The second WP focuses on the description of the coupling between RF wave and magnetized plasmas. The third WP aims at understanding the heat and particle flux patterns on surfaces immersed in such plasmas, with a view to control these fluxes for various applications. The fourth WP focuses specifically on the improvement of one of these applications, the cleaning of mirrors in magnetic fusion devices. The last WP is devoted to the understanding of the influence of surface properties and plasma conditions on the triggering and dynamics of unipolar arcs, in order to suppress or to tame them in various applications.",NA,external_funding,Active,4513028,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,586,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

The project builds on our experience and successful joint projects in classroom research and human value development. The project will set the foundations for theory building on formation of values in the school context. This knowledge is essential for providing evidence-based guidance for values education in schools. The formation of children's values in primary school is at the core of school curricula and educational frameworks in Europe, and more specifically in Switzerland (Lehrplan 21) and the UK (Department of Education, 2014). Values express broad goals (kindness, curiosity) that are important to a person in life, and they are linked to behaviour. Primary schools are expected to develop children's understanding of their own and others' values, children's ability to express their own values and pursue behaviours that help achieving them. In most recent years there has been a steep increase of publications, including the first special section on value development from childhood to early adulthood and research which highlights the impact of the family context and value-based educational goals on children's value development. However, the field is still surprisingly under-researched, and there is a lack of evidence of how children's values develop and how they are formed in primary school. The proposed four-year collaborative project (Switzerland and UK) will help fill this research gap.  The findings from this project will be published in leading international journals with a focus on open science.

Infectious complications are independent predictors of prognosis being the leading cause of decompensation, liver failure and death. Infection susceptibility due to immuneparesis has been proposed to substantially accelerate progression of cirrhosis; underlying mechanisms remain underexplored. Currently development of targeted immune-modulatory therapy is debated. Recent work from my group discovered distinct subsets of the monocytic lineage in the circulation of patients with cirrhosis at different stages: Monocytic myeloid derived suppressor cells (M-MDSC) (Bernsmeier et al., 2018), immune-regulatory CD14+DR+AXL+ (Brenig et al., submitted) and CD14+MERTK+ cells (Bernsmeier et al., 2015a). In advanced stages of cirrhosis these dysfunctional subsets prevailed over regular monocytes, associated with reduced capacity to repel microbial challenge, infection susceptibility and adverse prognosis. Our proof-of-principle experiments verified enhanced innate immune function of these subsets by specific agonists and inhibitors, respectively. It is evident, that monocyte and tissue macrophage differentiation appears context specific. In line with this, we revealed a distinct diversity of monocytic cell differentiation (CD14+DR+AXL+; CD14+MERTK+) in the circulation and liver.Overall objectives: The primary objective is to systematically decipher the diversity of monocyte and macrophage differentiation in different compartments in patients with cirrhosis at different stages ex vivo on a transcriptional (scRNAseq), translational (FACS,IHC) and functional level (diverse methods). Specific aims The secondary aim is to dissect mechanisms of monocyte/ macrophage differentiation including the influence of diverse compartmental cells and soluble factors in in vitro models, and the longitudinal effect of bacterial infection and sterile inflammation in patients with cirrhosis ex vivo. The tertiary aim is to evaluate a potential translation to future immunotherapy using agents modulating monocyte and macrophage function in vitro and a murine model of fibrosis.Expected results and impact: We expect to identify the composition of functionally distinct monocyte/macrophage subsets in different compartments and stages of cirrhosis. Moreover we expect to understand the underlying context specific mechanisms, as well as systemic and compartmental effects of specific immune-modulatory agents. Detailed knowledge of the diversity, compartmentalisation and function of distinct subsets of the monocyte-macrophage lineage at different stages of cirrhosis enhances our understanding of the underlying complex pathophysiology and enables a valid discussion about possible immunotherapeutic strategies that may revert immune function, and reduce need for liver transplantation and death. Specific immune-modulatory agents targeting these monocyte/macrophage subsets (M-MDSC, CD14+DR+AXL+, CD14+MERTK) have been tested in pre-clinical studies in humans and a translation to patients with cirrhosis seems possible, if shown sensible in regards to compartment specific effects.",NA,external_funding,Active,4514612,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,588,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

In cases of male factor infertility treated with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), the choice of which sperm to micro-inject may influence the clinical outcome [2]. Several studies have suggested that microscopic selection of sperm, based upon morphology, could potentially increase ICSI success ([3, 4] however, this selection is subjectively determined by an embryologist. Analysis of sperm from fertile and infertile men have revealed that a wide variety of parameters measured in human sperm vary substantially, with some correlating with fertility via natural conception or ART. However, to date functional data linking objectively identified sperm sub-populations to successful therapeutic outcomes remain sparse. Work from my laboratory has pioneered the usage of fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate sperm from patients based on impermeability to a nucleic acid dye (YO-PRO-1). Sperm selected in this way exhibit decreased levels of DNA fragmentation ([5], and have been used in a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to successfully generate healthy full-term offspring (De Geyter et al. submitted). Despite these positive preliminary results, further improvements in ART success rates are needed.Here we propose a series of detailed analyses on sperm of age-matched fertile and infertile men to determine the co-occurrence of known markers of ART failure on individual sperm. We will predominantly focus on factors involved in chromatin compaction and epigenetic status of sperm genome, which is considered to regulate gene expression in conceived embryos. We will therefore compare sperm of two groups of infertile men who differ in their ability to support pre-implantation development after fertilization. The first cohort corresponds to men of couples whom were previously treated with ART, but in whom fewer than the expected number of embryos developed to the blastocyst stage. The other half of the infertile men will be selected from a cohort of couples previously treated with ART, in whom more than half of the fertilized oocytes developed to the blastocyst stage. By using image quantitation pipelines, we will expand the reproducibility and sensitivity of such assays, determining whether combinations of measurements provide improved prognostic outcomes. We will also investigate a series of novel nucleic acid dyes to examine unique features of sperm chromatin. Following our identification of subpopulations of sperm, we will use FACS to isolate these populations for further characterization. We will perform extensive molecular characterizations of prominent epigenetic markers in the sperm genome. We will determine the genome wide distributions of histone proteins, their modifications and of DNA methylation as well as global RNA expression signatures in sub-populations of human sperm. Through such comparative genome-wide studies, we aim to identify the molecular foundations of sperm variation, potentially providing molecular explanations for the majorly different efficiencies in driving embryonic development among men with seemingly normal semen.",NA,external_funding,Active,4514635,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,589,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

The commonest disease course involves relapses with new neurological symptoms, followed by remission, against a background of slowly worsening disability known as progression. Several treatments are available to prevent relapses but their impact on progression is moderate and decreases with disease duration. In particular, depleting CD20-expressing cells with monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab is highly effective in the relapsing-remitting stage of the diseases. The majority of CD20-expressing cells are B cells, and the speed of the therapeutic effect suggests that peripheral, rather than CNS-resident B cells are the target. We describe two alternative hypothetical mechanisms that could explain the involvement of peripheral B cells in causing demyelinating lesions within the CNS, and propose experiments to test them. We assume that lymphocyte invasion of the CNS is initiated by T cells that encounter their cognate antigen within the CNS. The first hypothesis posits that these T cells are responding to a non-autoimmune stimulus such as a virus reactivation, and that the autoimmune component is mediated by B cells. The second hypothesis posits that the pioneer T cells are themselves autoreactive, and are activated by B cells in the periphery. 1.2 Overall ObjectiveThe objective of this project is to test two competing hypotheses to explain the mechanism of action of CD20 depletion, and to investigate whether the same mechanisms are connected to the more serious problem of ongoing progression. This will require the acquisition of much basic information about the biology of B cell trafficking, most of which will be done with animal models. We will also test some predictions of the two hypotheses in the real disease, using samples from patients with MS, and suitable controls.1.3 Specific Aims We aim to test the following hypotheses:Hypothesis 1: Relapses are caused by myelin-reactive B cells that traffic into the brain in response to local immune activity, and secrete myelin-binding antibodies.Hypothesis 2: Relapses are caused by autoreactive T cells, activated by virus-specific B cells that have co-captured self antigens, in the context of a peripheral viral infection.",NA,external_funding,Active,4514737,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,590,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"Zardo, Ilaria",NA,Departement Physik / Experimental Material Physics (Zardo),Hydronics,2020,"Hydrodynamic transport of heat or charge in solids is an exotic phenomenon, discovered more than 50 years ago for the case of coherent thermal transport (""second sound""), that has gained much prominence recently, due to its prediction and experimental observation in low-dimensional materials and nanostructures. While in most materials internal scattering processes lead to diffusive transport, pronounced anisotropy, low-dimensionality, or reduced temperatures can lead to hydrodynamic transport. These include coherent propagation of transport excitations, vortices in the viscous hydrodynamic transport, peculiar dependence on temperature or magnetic field, friction, slip and super-linear dependence of conductance as a function of width. Recent observations of hydrodynamic effects in 2D materials (graphene or 2DEGs) and in anisotropic 3D materials (PdCoO, SrTiO3, WP2) for both charge and heat are striking, deserve extensive microscopic understanding, and can lead to engineering novel devices. There are major open key questions addressed in this proposal: i. Theory and simulation: Several hydrodynamic transport regimes have been posited - from second sound and coherent transport waves to friction effects in nanostructures. Viscosities can now be predicted and provide a bridge between Boltzmann transport and Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics. ii. Materials science: To reach the hydrodynamic regime materials will have to be cleanly fabricated. There is no sufficient understanding of the role of defects or of the influence of substrates and boundaries on the emergence of the hydrodynamic regime. iii. Experimental physics: Certain hydrodynamic signatures are yet to be confirmed experimentally, others have been shown only once and need to be reproduced. Oftentimes, evidence of hydrodynamic transport has to be based on several different effects to be conclusive. Further, clean demonstrations need to be developed for the measurement of heat, which pose well-known methodological challenges. iv. Device engineering: Materials, for which a hydrodynamic transport regime is expected, often fall into the realm of future device applications for other reasons (e.g., topological protection, high electronic mobility, optoelectronic properties). It is unclear how future, scaled devices will either suffer from hydrodynamics, or can even exploit hydrodynamic transport for device functionality. These research questions motivate a synergetic approach combining these four areas of science by partnering of four research groups with leading expertise in all these areas. Furthermore, it is proposed to combine the study of hydrodynamic effects in both heat and charge transport to exploit obvious synergies, such as the important role of electron-phonon scattering. The project will create a theoretical framework to extract hydrodynamic parameters (e.g. the viscosity of a phonon system) from first principles. Materials will be grown and patterned to explore the limitations of designable hydrodynamic systems. Then, materials will be designed by layering and patterning of geometries to control hydrodynamic effects. Experiments will measure second-sound (pump-probe laser spectroscopy), non-local dissipation (scanning thermal microscopy), and quantify thermal, electrical and thermoelectric conductance and magnetoconductance of samples as a function of their dimensions.

The demographic challenges brought mostly by an ageing population imply that the old-age dependency ratio is a major concern. The increasing number of older adults mean more healthcare demands, greater healthcare costs, and high caregiving burden. Our society today faces a difficult situation where we find it hard to address the needs of the rising number of older persons. One of the proposed solutions to remedy this alarming situation is smart home health technology. These technologies could help decrease costs of maintaining older people and securing their safety both at home and in institutions. However, many social and ethical issues have been raised with the use of such technologies, amongst others, informed consent/autonomy, privacy, data safety, gaps in information and support about use and access to smart home technologies; and fears that such technology may replace the much needed human contact. To the best of our knowledge, little is known on how the Swiss population views the acceptance of smart home health technologies for elder care. Thus our project, RESOURCE, will critically evaluate the knowledge, willingness, and concerns associated with the use of smart home technologies in the care of older persons, particularly, the ethical and social concerns. The project has three specific objectives and uses mixed-method approach coupled with normative-empirical analysis. Module 1 includes qualitative methods where we will first capture the knowledge, attitudes, and wishes of the direct end-users (the older persons at home or in nursing homes) and their caregivers (both family members and healthcare professionals).

This microbiota directly improves plant health by securing the quality of the root and rhizosphere niche space by preventing pathogens to establish. Moreover, the root microbiota has important indirect functions for plant health as it becomes apparent in plant-soil feedbacks or in disease suppressive soils. For instance, the selective recruitment of beneficial microbiota members by plants result in a soil-borne immune memory at the benefit of the next plant generation. Specific compositions of the complex soil microbiota can prime a 'state of alert' in plants and induce systemic resistance and thereby improve plant health. Relatively little is known about the underlying mechanisms how plants respond to feedbacks of the soil microbiota. It emerges that not all plant genotypes are able to respond to beneficial microbiomes and that there is genetic variation in plant responsiveness to microbiota feedbacks. This is where this research project comes into play with the goal to establish the basic understanding of the underlying mechanisms and the genetic architecture of BX-dependent growth suppression. It is structured in three work packages with the first one investigating whether the root microbiota enhances their feedback when plants are under pathogen attack and 'cry for help'.

It has been shown that changes in the composition of the gut microbiota influence normal physiology and contribute to diseases ranging from obesity to psychiatric diseases such as major depressive disorder (MDD). Emerging evidence indicate that the gut microbiota communicates with the central nervous system via endocrine, immune and neural pathways and thereby influences brain function and behaviour. Elucidating the pathways linking gut-microbiota and the brain may allow detecting potential biomarkers that could be used in psychiatry. There is a particular need in patients with MDD to identify biomarkers that can stratify patients into more homogeneous groups to achieve better treatment outcomes. This is of great importance as almost two thirds of MDD patients do not respond to current treatment approaches.   This project seeks to identify multidimensional biomarkers for probiotic treatment response in patients with MDD. In particular, the present proposal investigates the effect of short-term probiotic augmentation on immunological, inflammatory, microbial, genetic and neural markers along the brain-gut axis in patients with depression and whether baseline expression of these potential biomarkers predicts the individual clinical response to probiotic treatment. In line with the concept of personalized medicine, such predictive biomarkers allow patient stratification by targeting those individuals who are actually going to benefit from probiotic augmentation. Moreover, identifying biological targets that are associated with the clinical response to probiotic treatment further enables the development of novel and more effective nutrition-based interventions for patients with MDD.  ","probiotic supplementation, depression, biomarker, personalised psychiatry",external_funding,Completed,4522431,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,596,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Furthermore, the progress in nanofabrication enables the design and fabrication of nanostructures that can control heat transport by means of interference effects, achieving coherent phonon transport, and allowing exciting experiments (see e.g. Nature 503, 209 (2013)). In the frame of this project, we propose nanowires as platform for investigating and designing the phonon interference effects because they offer unique possibilities in terms of heterostructuring (i.e. combining materials that cannot be joined in 2D because of lattice mismatch and realizing crystal phase superlattices). Specifically, we want to explore superlattice nanowires and nanowires junctions. Both systems are ideal platforms for exploring phonons interference effects. We will perform pump-probe inelastic light scattering experiments, which gives important information on the time scale of phonon dynamics. It allows a direct determination of the absolute phonon mode population and of its temporal evolution. We will also perform pump-probe experiments in a spatially resolved manner in order to measure the phonon mean free path and coherence length of (selectively) excited phonon modes. Pump-probe experiments will also be conducted on nanostructures integrated in devices consisting of suspended SiNx membranes with implemented metallic coils, which can be used both as heaters and thermometers. In this way, we will be able to probe the time evolution of both coherent and incoherent excitations.",NA,external_funding,Active,4528250,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,599,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

It is characterized by hyper-proliferation and accumulation oflymphoid progenitor cells in the bone marrow and blood with invasion into other tissues duringprogression of disease (3, 4). Even though pediatric ALL has a high survival rate, relapsed disease,organ infiltration or disease onset during adolescence are challenging to be treated effectively. Thishighlights the importance of a better understanding of the disease mechanisms. Our preliminary datauncovered a hitherto unknown expression of the desmosomal adhesion molecule desmoglein-2(DSG2) in two ALL cell lines (Jurkat T-ALL and REH B-ALL), while primary human lymphocytes donot express this protein under baseline condition but during proliferation after PHA stimulation.Importantly, reduction of DSG2 expression by shRNA significantly impaired Jurkat cell viability,suggesting a role of DSG2 in leukemia progression. In the proposed project, the malignant potentialof DSG2-deficient ALL cell lines will be clarified by applying these cells in transendothelial migrationassays, 3D bone marrow organoid colonization, and in vivo xenograft mouse model. Furthermore,samples from ALL patients affected by different subtypes will be screened for DSG2 expressioncompared to healthy controls. In these samples, DSG2 protein levels will be reduced by lentivirallydelivered shDSG2. The effect of DSG2 depletion on lymphoblast function will be determined with afocus on the contribution to cell proliferation, adhesion and infiltration. With this proposal we willcombine the knowledge of a Mexico-based immunobiology laboratory and an associatedoncoimmunology group with access to patient samples and expertise in ALL and leukemia mousemodels with a Swiss cell adhesion research group with focus on function of desmosomal molecules.This collaboration includes exchange of scientists, samples, material and expertise.

In the fields of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR), the number of ARCR procedures and published studies has grown exponentially in the last decade, yet reporting standards differ dramatically. This is particularly notable concerning adverse events (AE) as in most fields of orthopedic surgery. In addition, published prognostic studies were methodologically poor, based on small datasets and explored only limited numbers of potentially influencing factors.A prospective multicenter clinical study of a large ARCR patient cohort will be implemented on a representative group of 17 Swiss and one German specialized clinics allowing for the evaluation of targeted core safety, clinical and patient-reported outcomes. The primary objective will be the development of prediction models for individual patients. The primary outcomes will be the patient-reported subjective assessment of shoulder function (Oxford Shoulder Score) and the occurrence of shoulder stiffness up to 12 months after primary repair surgery. Multiple prognostic factors will be investigated including patient baseline demographics, psychological, socioeconomic and clinical factors, rotator cuff integrity and concomitant local findings, operative and postoperative management factors. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the content and applicability of a consensus core set of AEs (CES) considering the patient's perspective, validate a severity classification for AEs, and quantify clinically-relevant ARCR outcomes up to 24 months postoperatively. Prognostic models will also be extended to all secondary outcomes.A sample size of 970 ARCR patients will be included; baseline patient demographics, history, shoulder status, magnetic resonance imaging based diagnosis and operative details will be recorded. Patient outcomes will be documented 6, 12 and 24 months after surgery. Clinical examinations at 6 and 12 months will include shoulder range of motion and strength (Constant Score), as well as the documentation of AEs. Tendon repair integrity status will be assessed by ultrasound examination at 12 months. Patient-reported outcome questionnaires at all follow-up time points will determine functional scores (Subjective Shoulder Value, Oxford Shoulder Score), anxiety and depression scores, working status, quality of life (EuroQol EQ-5D-5L), and AEs. All AEs will be documented according to the consensus CES and classified by their degree of severity; patients will rate the perceived severity and disturbance of experienced AEs. We will use the web-based REDCap data capture system for data management. Intensive central monitoring will be performed and investigator meetings will be coordinated during the study. The adapted AE severity classification will be validated. All data will be tabulated and prediction models will be developed using internationally supported methodology.This project will initiate the development of personalized risk predictions to support the surgical decision process in ARCR.

"Landert, Daniela",NA,Departement Sprach- und Literaturwissenschaften / Fachbereich Englische Sprach- und Literaturwissenschaft,The Pragmatics of Improvised Drama Comedy,2020,"This research project is situated within the field of pragmatics of fiction, which deals with communicative aspects of fictional texts. While the research area has attracted increasing interest in recent years, it has been restricted to scripted fictional texts, such as novels, scripted plays and films. Our aim is to expand the scope of the field by studying improvised theatre, an art form in which actors perform stories that are collectively improvised on the spot, usually based on suggestions by audience members. From a pragmatic point of view, improvised theatre is highly interesting because it is defined by two factors that set it apart from other types of fictional texts. First, the text is created while the audience is present; and second, it is created without any options for revisions. Thus, while the resulting texts have many similarities with scripted plays, the communicative framework in which they are produced includes two aspects that are more typical of spontaneous conversations than of scripted fiction. This presents exciting opportunities for studying the communicative aspects of fictional texts from a novel perspective and it promises to throw new light on how individual factors of the communicative framework influence text production. The overall objective of the project is to study how the specifics of the communicative framework of improvised theatre affect the fictional text and its creation. More specifically, the project will focus on three topics that have already been investigated from a pragmatic perspective in scripted fictional texts, namely humour, characterisation and dialogues. These topics are studied by comparing improvised theatre to scripted fiction and to conversational interaction. Thus, the research questions of the project are: - How does the way in which humour, characterisation, and dialogue are realised differ between scripted and improvised fictional texts? - How are the observed differences related to the co-presence of the audience, especially the option to receive feedback from the audience during the process of creation? The data for this research project will consist of a corpus of video material and transcriptions that will be compiled as part of the project. In addition to improvised theatre in English the corpus also includes scripted fiction from television series, which makes it possible to compare the two types of data. Additional data from existing corpora of conversational interaction will be used to compare the characteristics of dialogues in fictional texts to non-fictional spontaneous interaction. These data will be analysed using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods of pragmatic analysis in the tradition of pragmatics of fiction.  The results of the analysis will show that improvised theatre shares characteristics with both scripted fiction and with conversational interaction. By studying specific features across different settings, it will become apparent how both the fictional nature of a text and its degree of composition influence its form. In this way, the insights gained from studying improvised theatre will bridge the gap between research on scripted fictional texts and research on spontaneous interaction, showing that there are more similarities and continuities between these sets of data than previously thought. The findings of this project will make an important contribution to the field of pragmatics, especially the pragmatics of fiction, since they will provide information on the role of two specific factors of the communicative framework of fictional texts that have not been studied in isolation so far. The results will help differentiate between text characteristics that are related to the fictional nature of the text and characteristics that are related to the conditions under which the text is created. In a wider perspective, the results of the project contribute to a better understanding of how text production is influenced by the communicative framework in general and, more specifically, by individual factors like fictionality, interaction, spontaneity and immediacy. In addition, the project will also contribute to neighbouring fields, such as literary stylistics, improvisation studies and theatre and performance studies.","Pragmatics, Pragmatics of Fiction, Humour, Improvisation Studies, Literary Stylistics, Participation Framework, Fictional Dialogues, Characterisation, Spontaneity, Conversation Analyis, Spoken Language",external_funding,Active,4512166,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,605,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

The proposed project comprises three aims that include 1) the development of imaging tools in magnetic fields compatible with mobile and portable designs, 2) the validation of simultaneous multi-parametric imaging that quantifies stroke related metrics, and 3) in vivo investigation of contrast and specificity of low field MRI in acute stroke. Background When stroke strikes, every minute counts. Today, the greatest challenges in the management of stroke patients are 1) to rapidly separate between ischemic and hemorrhagic events which call for completely opposite treatments, and 2) to establish robust new markers of ischemia in the first three hours offering the best patient outcomes, potentially leading to full functional recovery. Technological Leap Over the last 30 years, MRI has developed to become the modality of choice in radiology thanks to unmatched contrast and spatial resolution. Yet, due to high costs and siting requirements MRI is less available or flexible than X-ray based or ultrasound (US) imaging. Lowering magnetic fields to envision agile, ""point-of-care"" devices is a concept that has gained considerable momentum over the last 3 years and yet few of this work reports on imaging performance and focuses predominantly on hardware. The present project proposes to combine synergistically high-performance imaging in low-sensitivity and inhomogeneous regimes with the uncovering of new metrics to quantify the earliest phase of stroke unique to low magnetic field physics. Impact of proposed research The expected long term societal and economical outcomes in the context of stroke is a radical improvement of recovery and survival rates in stroke patients from accelerated decision making and future devices sited in the field, reducing drastically the cost of health inherent to stroke patient management.","Stroke diagnosis, novel contrasts, magnetic resonance physics, low magnetic field strength",external_funding,Active,4516720,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,606,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Fueled by the practical interest of controlling molecular motion/diffusion in organic synthesis, catalysis,... , throughout history we witnessed ever ingenious ways to control/activate the motion of molecules: from the plainold heating and stirring, up to microwave and laser guided molecular streams[1]. Yet, a seemingly control of molecularmotion at solid interfaces has thus far remained elusive. The challenge stems from understanding how an externalstimuli (e.g. light, electrical or chemical energy) can be harnessed to induce structural modifications or altermolecule-surface interactions in such way that generates motion. Such understanding would benefit not only the surfacechemistry at large (e.g. on-surface synthesis[2] and catalysis[3]) but also the growing community of nanoscale syntheticmolecular machines[4,5] since most their biomolecular counterparts operate at interfaces[6]. The difficulty to direct themotion of molecules over surfaces is perhaps best realized considering that in the 1st nanocar/molecular race[7] only twoout of 7 world class research groups were able to meet the challenge. This consisted in propelling a molecule (each teamcould bring its ""best contender"") along 100nm in less than 30h!!

Reinvigoration of T cell function by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) can result in impressive clinical responses, but is effective only in a minority of cancer patients. The mechanisms involved in T cell dysfunction, and particularly its involvement in ICI therapy is still not fully understood. Moreover, the development of novel cancer immunotherapies urgently requires comprehensive understanding of molecular initiators and promotors of T cell dysfunction. Here, we have developed an ex vivo human model system to mimic tumor-specific T cell dysfunction in human cancers. To this end, circulating CD8 T cells from non-cancer individuals are transduced with a T cell receptor construct specifically recognizing a human tumor-associated antigen. Subsequently, these T cells are exposed to repetitive stimulation utilizing antigenic peptides with different affinities. We can demonstrate that this procedure stably renders CD8 T cells dysfunctional. The latter acquire a state which highly resembles CD8 T cells found in human tumors on a phenotypic and transcriptional level. Importantly, this model is capable to produce a high number of antigen-specific dysfunctional T cells sufficient to overcome restraints imposed by the limited availability of tumor-infiltrating T cells with unknown antigen specificity obtained from cancer patients. By taking advantage of this model, we aim to dissect individual genes or group of genes critical for the generation of T cell dysfunction and identify key genes and downstream pathways that could be targeted for T cell reinvigoration. To this end, we propose to perform an unbiased and comprehensive loss-of-function CRISPR screen with the following major research aims: (i) to discover genes involved in inducing and/or maintaining T cell dysfunction, and (ii) to mechanistically dissect how these genes are involved in T cell dysfunction. Experimentally, we will develop CRISPR-Cas9 mediated knockout systems scaled up to a genome-wide scale in antigen-specific CD8 T cells by co-transduction with a tumor antigen-specific T cell receptor and pooled single guide RNAs, combined with Cas9 protein electroporation. Initial experiments have already demonstrated the feasibility of the approach. After repetitive antigenic stimulation in compliance with our model system, the dysfunctional T cells will be restimulated and divided into functional/non-functional populations to systematically identify potential target genes that are critical in mediating T cell dysfunctionality. Validation of target gene knockouts will be accomplished in primary CD8 T cells and organotypic culture systems derived from cancer patients, utilizing proteomic and siRNA approaches. In addition, we will investigate the impact of target gene knockouts/inhibition using mouse tumor models of adoptive transfer and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) obtained from melanoma patients in the framework of a newly established clinical program for TIL transfer in our center.

Substantive Law, Procedure, & Verdicts in Ambient Intelligent Environments",2020,"Criminal law was designed by humans to create order amongst ourselves. Accordingly, its fundamental concepts, such as the notion of free will or the concept of a free appraisal of evidence or the claim of dignity and autonomy of parties to the criminal proceeding, are uniquely human. However, this human-centric approach is at risk of losing its place as a primary guiding principle as (ro)bot-human interactions increase. Until now, such collaboration has not had special standing in criminal law despite the fact that robots in various forms, software bots as well as standalone machines, already gather and process information, draw conclusions on behalf of humans and cooperate with them, or even act autonomously as their agents. Ongoing digitalization, or the increase in ambient intelligent environments, may gradually require a change in the traditional method of establishing the elements of alleged cri-minal conduct and in the way in which such elements are proven in court when human-robot collaboration turns detrimental. This, in turn, may have repercussions upon the narratives in criminal verdicts. This project assesses the consequences of (ro)bot-human interactions in ambient intelligent environments. It primarily uses the example of technology surveying human drivers in modern cars in the course of driving automation. This includes software bots as well as physically independent smart devices that are made for enhancing safety in road traffic in the context of Swiss penal law. The goal is to understand legal changes and predict further impacts upon criminal law. The project will cover three working packages; packages one and two will be dissertation projects and the third will be a joint project among a group of scholars in comparative criminal law, engineering and law and legal narratives. The working packages will build upon each other, addressing the following questions:  Substantive Criminal Law: What are the potential changes in the assessment of subjective (mens rea) elements of crimes in penal traffic law cases, particularly when robots issue war-nings to humans based on their assessment of drivers' behavior? Criminal Procedure: What are the challenges for fact-finding and evidence evaluation in cri-minal proceedings after fatal traffic accidents involving evidence from monitoring technology? Specifically, must defense rights be modified as a consequence to the use of certain machine-generated evidence so as to provide sufficient protection to the human driver standing trial? Digital shifts and its impact on narratives in criminal verdicts: How do criminal courts assess and prove mens rea in traffic incidents? Does the approach change with driving automation? Where do different criminal justice systems, with diverging legal traditions, technology adoption and traffic regulations, differ in explaining and establishing responsibility? Are there any commonalities?    Smart safety devices in modern cars provide poignant examples of everyday human-robot collaboration that foreshadows a number of specific effects upon penal law. Within the domain of substantive criminal law, the demarcation of a negligent act from an intentional crime could change entirely when the mens rea could be inferred from a person's response to (ro)bot advice. For instance, if a drowsiness detection system alerts a driver to take a break but the driver continues, eventually causing an accident, courts may be inclined to infer negligence or even intent as a result of the driver disregarding the advice. Yet, criminal procedure might not grant an adequate defense to human drivers. In criminal proceedings the importance of human testimony, most notably a defendant's admission, will lose standing, while machine-based evidence will gain traction. For example, if a drowsiness detection system assesses a driver as sleepy, how can the driver challenge this machine-evidence if it is presented against him in court? Finally, verdicts will have to explain responsibility sharing in (ro)bot-human interactions and how machine-generated data was evaluated against human statements to justify an acquittal or conviction. With the ongoing automation of driving, robots monitoring humans will take over a crucial safety functions, like in Take Over Requests (TOR) when a car wants to hand over after having performed the dynamic driving tasks itself and must ensure the human driver is in fact capable of taking the steering wheel. As robots will likely become more embedded in our lives, similar issues will arise in other aspects of human life.",NA,external_funding,Active,4500626,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,610,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE
"Lehmann, Moritz",NA,Departement Umweltwissenschaften / Geochemie Stoffkreisläufe (Lehmann),Expression of benthic isotope effects associated with nitrogen elimination and regeneration in lacustrine sediments,2020,"In many ocean regions, as a limiting nutrient, bioavailable nitrogen (N) controls marine primary productivity and thus the ocean's capacity to fix and sequester atmospheric CO2 in its interior. In many lakes, N from both natural and anthropogenic sources is an important driver of eutrophication. Therefore, both in the ocean and in lakes, it is crucial to understand the sources and sinks of fixed N. Denitrification, the microbial reduction of nitrate to dinitrogen (N2), and other modes of suboxic N2 production (e.g., the anaerobic oxidation of ammonium, or anammox), are the most important sinks of fixed N in aquatic environments, but particularly with regards to the N cycle in the ocean, there is a persistent debate regarding the overall size of sinks and sources. Isotope ratios of nitrogenous species (e.g., 15N/14N) can provide important constraints on the natural N cycle. In order to use stable isotope measurements as a means to trace fluxes of N in aquatic systems, however, it is imperative to understand the isotope effects associated with these fluxes. While denitrification at the organism-level is known to be associated with a marked N isotope fractionation, the expression of the N isotope effect of benthic (i.e., sedimentary) denitrification in the water column above is only poorly constrained, and likely varies with the environmental conditions. Moreover, the possible impacts of other benthic N cycling processes on the N isotope exchange between the sediments and the water column (e.g., anammox, nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), nitrate uptake, and/or nitrate regeneration) remain uncertain. Understanding the overall N isotope effect of net benthic N loss is a prerequisite for using N isotope measurements to infer its relative importance in the N cycle, in the global ocean or in a specific environment. Here we propose an in-depth investigation of the isotope effects of benthic fixed N elimination and nitrate regeneration in aquatic sediments. The prime goal of the proposed research is to build a thorough understanding of the modulating controls on the nitrate and nitrite N (and O) isotope signatures of denitrification and anammox (and the interacting effects from other benthic N cycling reactions), and the N isotopic composition of gaseous N (i.e., N2 and N2O) that is ultimately lost from the sediments. We predict that the expression of the biological isotope effect of benthic N elimination at the level of sediment-water exchange will vary across different environments, and will strongly depend on the reactivity of the sediments, the O2 penetration, the physical boundary conditions (i.e., diffusive transport), and on the extent to which other processes than denitrification contribute to the overall N cycling (nitrification, anammox, DNRA). Combining 1.) laboratory experiments with natural and artificial sediments, 2.) field investigations into the sediment porewater (N and O) isotope dynamics of distinct lacustrine and marine denitrifying benthic environments, and 3.) mathematical modeling, and making use of innovative multi-isotope techniques (natural abundance isotope analysis of NO3-/ NO2-, ammonium, dissolved organic N, and N2O, as well as 15N tracer experiments), we attempt to gain complementary information on how the combined isotope effects of benthic nitrate reduction and nitrate regeneration are expressed in the water column of lakes and the ocean. With the diagenetic porewater N isotope model that this project will deliver we will establish a quantitative framework for assessing benthic isotope fluxes and for verifying our hypotheses. The research proposed will result in the first comprehensive characterization of sediment pore-water N (and O) isotope dynamics in lacustrine settings, and will allow experimental constraints on the variability of N isotope effects during benthic nitrate reduction across different biogrochemical regimes. While the field component of the project focuses on lake sediments, the results expected will be directly pertinent to understanding of fixed-N elimination isotope effects in the ocean.

"Marzolini, Catia",NA,Bereich Medizinische Fächer (Klinik) / Infektiologie (Battegay M),Use of physiologically based pharmacokinetic modelling to simulate dosing requirements of long-acting intramuscular antiretroviral drugs in special populations and to manage drug-drug interactions,2020,"Combined antiretroviral treatments have significantly improved the morbidity and mortality related to HIV infection thus transforming HIV infection into a chronic disease. However, the efficacy of antiretroviral treatments is highly dependent on the ability of infected individuals to adhere to life-long drug combination therapies. Incomplete treatment adherence can indeed promote the emergence of drug-resistant HIV viruses resulting in loss of virological control and leading consequently to the risk of HIV transmission. A major milestone will be achieved in 2019 with the marketing of the first long-acting intramuscular antiretroviral drugs, cabotegravir and rilpivirine, for the treatment and prevention of HIV infection. Intramuscular injections create a ""depot"" in the muscle from where the drug is released for an extended period thus allowing for infrequent drug administration (e.g. once a month or bimonthly) with the potential to improve adherence to therapy and treatment satisfaction. Although intramuscular formulations hold great promises for long-term treatment of HIV infection, a number of questions about their optimal use remain unresolved. The absorption and bioavailability of drugs administered intramuscularly is impacted by factors such as obesity, exercise and blood flow in the muscle, thus cabotegravir and rilpivirine pharmacokinetics in special HIV infected populations like obese, elderly or pregnant women is currently unknown. Furthermore, intramuscular release of drugs cannot be interrupted, therefore the management of drug-drug interactions (DDI) with any inducing/inhibiting comedications required to treat inaugural diseases (e.g. epilepsy, mycobacterial infection) while on long-acting intramuscular therapy is also unknown. The aims of this project are a) to characterize the pharmacokinetics of intramuscular cabotegravir and rilpivirine and dosing requirements in special populations and b) to simulate dosage adjustments to overcome DDIs using physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling. This technique allows the prediction of drug pharmacokinetics in virtual individuals (generated considering anatomical and physiological changes related to a specific condition like obesity, aging or pregnancy) using in vitro data and a mathematical description of drug distribution after intramuscular administration thus offering the possibility to simulate clinical scenarios of interest. The performance of the PBK models will be verified by comparing simulated intramuscular profiles of cabotegravir and rilpivirine against available clinical data (obtained in a standard population). After successful prediction, simulations will be carried out in special populations. This research project is of particular clinical importance as it will provide guidance on dosing requirements in special populations, which have not been evaluated during drug development but which may also benefit from this novel treatment paradigm aiming to improve the chances of life-long maintenance of HIV suppression. In addition, this project will provide guidance on the management of DDIs, which are not always preventable because intramuscular injections are not reversible. Addressing these questions will enable to broaden the use of injectable antiretroviral drugs thus offering an effective strategy for the treatment and prevention of HIV infection and the perspective to curb the HIV epidemic.

Of particular concern are changing dietary habits and sedentary patterns, which predispose young-aged children to develop impairing non-communicable diseases (NCDs) later in life. The Healthy Active Kids South Africa Report Card (2018) showed that the levels of in-school physical activity among South African children do not meet the minimal requirements. Furthermore, the KaziBantu testing (2019) showed that a predominant proportion of children and teachers in marginalized schools in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, presented risk factors for non-communicable diseases. In this context, a school-based health programme comprising a children intervention (KaziKidz) and a teacher intervention (KaziHealth) was developed to enhance health literacy. However, sustainability of integrated health-interventions is key to ensure effective setting-specific measures that tackle the prevalence of chronic conditions and contributes to the improvement of overall community health.Goal and specific objectives:The purpose of this study is to follow-up this multi-faceted health promotion intervention in order to strengthen the evidence for its effectiveness in promoting long-lasting positive lifestyle changes among children and teachers in selected schools of marginalized areas of Port Elizabeth, South Africa. The specific objectives are: (i) To assess the long-term effectiveness of the intervention in reducing risk factors for non-communicable diseases in high-risk children and teachers; and (ii) to evaluate its sustainability in terms of feasibility, acceptance, adoption, implementation, maintenance and dissemination in disadvantaged communities.Methods:The proposed study here will be conducted in 8 quintile 3 primary schools and will follow a cohort of identified «at-risk» children and teachers over a 2-year period. Risk for NCDs is defined as presenting at least: (i) Pre- or hypertension; (ii) pre- or diabetes; (iii) borderline or hypercholesterolemia; and (iv) overweight or obesity. Assessments of health outcomes and behaviours of both children and teachers will be collected at two time points.

During the third century, the Roman Empire experienced military anarchy, civil wars, rampant inflation, severe famines, dramatic changes in the religious landscape, bloody persecutions of minority groups, and raids and invasions from beyond the frontier. What were the reasons and causal relationships underlying this concurrence of adverse events? Recent research has suggested that climate variations triggered these cascading shocks, but this theory has yet to be put to scrutiny through a comprehensive interdisciplinary analysis of all available evidence.Due to its unparalleled evidence, the Roman province of Egypt can serve as a laboratory to test such hypotheses and study social vulnerability, resilience, and adaptation strategies in the face of environmental and climatic changes. This pioneering and innovative project is an interdisciplinary collaboration between climate scientists, archaeologists, and ancient historians that bridges the traditional divide between the humanities and the natural sciences. The project aims to evaluate and interpret the effects of environmental stressors, and climate change on society, economy, and politics using third-century Roman Egypt as a case study for a multi-disciplinary approach to a fervently debated transition period in Western civilization.

Manifestations of TSC include benign tumors of the kidney, lung, heart, brain, eyes, liver, and skin as well as epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, and cognitive disabilities. Since TSC is caused by hyperactivation of mTORC1, the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin and its derivatives (rapalogs) were approved for the treatment of various TSC manifestations. However, the clinical applicability of the currently available mTORC1 inhibitors is limited by their specificity, effectiveness, and safety. Rapalogs fail to completely inhibit mTORC1 as they have little effect on inhibiting phosphorylation of 4E-BP, one of the two main targets of mTORC1. Moreover, since rapamycin and rapalogs target mTOR, they also inhibit mTORC2 when chronically administered. This leads to undesirable effects such as hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance. Thus, there is an unmet need for novel compounds that are truly selective and more effective in inhibiting mTORC1 to treat TSC. We have recently identified the mTORC1-specific subunit Raptor as a highly suitable and innovative target for TSC treatment. Raptor is crucial for physiological mTORC1 substrate recruitment. However, the Raptor substrate recognition site has not been targeted pharmacologically. We believe that Raptor-targeted mTORC1 inhibition is an effective method for pharmacological intervention, potentially more specific, more effective, and safer than rapamycin/rapalog-based mTORC1 inhibition.

Nevertheless, many orphan drugs get exceptions from these criteria and are reimbursed anyway. Yet, the more orphan drugs are authorized, the less their reimbursement can be based on exceptions, since this would require allocating a substantial portion of the healthcare budget to a small part of the population. Because orphan drug reimbursement is an ethical dilemma without a clear-cut solution, many authors call for public debates to legitimately solve this dilemma.

Advanced time-resolved Raman spectroscopies enable the extraction of relevant information such as phonon spectra, lifetimes, and relaxation times, all critical to understanding thermal transport through advanced materials. In this project we aim to apply these techniques to solve two important open questions: (i) how to engineer the temperature sensors of the future based on diamond-based materials; and (ii) understanding the underlying physical mechanism responsible for deviations from the macroscopic predictions for nanoscale system, such as hypersonic surface phononic crystals, critical to technological applications. For this purpose, I propose four main objectives to the project. First, implementing an ultrafast time-resolved spontaneous Raman method to access the timescale of the absolute phonon mode population. Second, implementing a time-resolved stimulated Raman spectroscopy technique to explore the coherence of selectively excited phonons. Third, extending this technique to a time-resolved coherent anti-Stokes Raman (CARS) spectroscopy to probe the population dephasing lifetime of the system and energy relaxation time.

Moreover, mental health disorders are consistently associated with decreased well-being.

In this research proposal I will examine how mental health can be improved, prosocial behaviors increased, and how the two interrelate. The overall objective of the research described in this grant is to test the effectiveness of interventions designed to promote mental health and prosocial behaviors. This will be conducted in three studies: one continuation study from the initial funding period and two new studies. The continuation study is a clinical effectiveness trial called ""Choose Change"" that tests the long-term effects of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) for a transdiagnostic group of treatment non-responders in both inpatients and outpatients. ACT trains people to increase psychological flexibility as a means to increasing well-being. Recruitment of patients into this trial are 91% complete and follow up assessments are ongoing. Preliminary analyses are promising. Expected results include information on the immediate and long-term effectiveness of training psychological flexibility for treatment non-responders, moderating effects of social variables, and information about mechanisms of change via the use of Event Sampling Methodology (ESM) throughout the trial. Advances in digital technology has led to a rapid growth of apps marketed to help people with mental health problems. Unfortunately, few have been tested and extant studies indicate that poor user utilization and adherence limits their effectiveness. Building on findings from the digital ESM data gathered during the first funding period (e.g., using technology to initiate behavioral intentions and monitor completions, social interactions, burden of items, etc.) this feasibility study will develop a ""Virtual Coach"" (app with integrated ESM) and test whether the combination of content based on psychological flexibility and state-of-the-art design (gamification, signaling, user options) can generate high adherence and treatment utility (i.e., via direct feedback to the patient and therapist). Expected results include information about adherence, utility, and mechanism of action that can be used to help patients increase well-being and deliver information needed to tailor interventions and apps that fit patients' current context and needs. The second new study uses an experimental design to test the conditions that are helpful in promoting prosocial behaviors in non-clinical small groups. Three groups of dyad strangers will be exposed to varying levels of a micro-intervention that promotes psychological flexibility: no, one, or both members of the dyad.

The EU-Symposium on the Awareness of Allergy 2016 declared that, chronic and allergic diseases are a major and growing health problem in Europe. Asthma presents as chronic airway inflammation and airway wall remodelling as the main pathologies. Anti-inflammatory drugs reduce inflammation, but do not affect airway wall remodelling. Our studies on asthma showed that epithelium derived heat shock protein (HSP) 60 activated the following mechanism in mesenchymal cells: HSP60 ? low C/EBP-a ? increased C/EBP-ß activity ? downregulated microRNA 19a ? increased Erk1/2 ? stimulated Stat3 ? increased PRMT1 ? high mitochondria and C/EBP-ß activity. Other asthma relevant cytokines including PDGF-BB, TNF-a, IL-1ß, and IL-4, also initiated this autologous self-sustaining mechanism in a cell type specific manner. Contrary to HSP60, epithelium derived HSP70 and HSP90 blocked airway remodelling. These data were generated from primary cell lines obtained from 6 hospitals: Basel (CH), Sydney (AU), Naples (IT), Liege (BE), Manitoba (CA), and Xi'an (CN).Overall objectives and specific aims: To understand the cause of asthma and airway wall remodelling with the aim to find new targets for therapy, and biomarkers to clearly diagnose asthma, to avoid misdiagnosis. The specific aims are to understand the following: (i) Does the ratio of C/EBP-a to C/EBP-ß in epithelial cells control the expression of HSP60, HSP70 and HSP90? (ii) Do secreted HSPs regulate C/EBP-isoforms in mesenchymal cells? According to the available literature, HSPs are controlled by C/EBPs. Hence, HSPs and C/EBPs may form an auto-regulative cycle, which we aim to explore. (iii) Which receptors mediate the effect of secreted HSPs on mesenchymal and epithelial cells? Others suggested that toll like receptors (TLRs) mediate the action of secreted HSPs, which was not confirmed in asthma. (iv) Which effect do HSP60, HSP70 and HSP90 have on remodelling and secretion of pro-inflammatory factors by epithelial and smooth muscle cells in asthma?Methods to be used: Using our available human primary cells, the cell type specific effects of recombinant human HSP60, HSP70 and HSP90 will be determined by 48-hour kinetic study using NGS, followed by KEGG analysis focusing on C/EBP regulating proteins. The effects of recombinant HSPs on the secretome of epithelial cells will be determined by mass spectrometry; the effect on mesenchymal cell secreted pro-inflammatory cytokines and extracellular matrix will be determined by ELISA. Mitochondria activity and structure will be determined by MitoTracker and immunofluorescence. C/EBPs will be upregulated by transfection with overexpression vectors, or downregulated by corresponding small inhibitory RNAs. Protein expression will be determined by Western-blotting and cell compartment distribution by immunofluorescence. The identified mechanism(s) will be verified in the rat in vivo model of asthma by our Chinese collaborator Prof Q. Sun (Xi'an), who has her own funding. Expected results and impact: The expected results will clarify the role of secreted HSPs and their regulation by C/EBPs in the pathogenesis of asthma. The results will provide new therapeutic targets for asthma, and may replace the use of inhaled corticosteroids, and thereby eliminating their side effects. Furthermore, the study will provide new asthma specific biomarkers, and thereby improve diagnosis.

LncRNAs play major roles in cardiac development and disease and in the development of cancer, and some lncRNAs have been implicated in cardiotoxicity. Importantly, lncRNAs are much more cell-type specific than protein-coding genes, making them attractive for targeted intervention.

However, the mechanisms orchestrating the development and function of the TME are largely unknown, especially in the brain where the overall immunosuppressive environment represents an additional challenge to overcome for the successful implementation of immunotherapies. In our lab, we have previously demonstrated that Notch signaling plays important roles during glioma formation by repressing tumor growth. However, the mechanisms underlying this Notch tumor suppressive activity in the brain remained elusive. I could recently show that Notch inhibition accelerates glioma progression by simultaneously unleashing the intrinsic proliferative potential of tumor cells and promoting immune evasion by the tumor cells. Notch-inhibited glioma cells become irresponsive to TME-derived signals including interferon gamma (IFNg), and show substantial alterations in their metabolic profile. The project I propose will address how Notch signaling, IFNg response and the metabolism of glioma cells interact to shape the tumor microenvironment and affect the response to immune modulatory therapies. I will explore novel Notch-dependent mechanisms that regulate the immune TME. I will also focus on metabolic changes occurring in glioma cells after Notch inhibition and that I hypothesize can alter the functionality of the immune cells. The results of this project will identify new molecular players governing the tumor-immune crosstalk and will open new opportunities in targeting the immune TME in gliomas.",NA,external_funding,Active,4598531,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,624,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

State-of-the-art systems, while very accurate, are too slow and too expensive to effectively detect infected subjects and help prevent the spread of a pandemic disease. While the digital remote consulting and assessment of symptomatic patients via phone or video call has been adopted, a remote diagnostic test remains lacking.3 Thus, our current paradigm to wait until symptoms appear before people are tested in centralized facilities is fundamentally flawed to fight diseases like COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by patients long before symptoms appear or even by asymptomatic patients.4,5 As the incubation period lasts several days,6 these issues lead to the creation of a blind spot: i.e. many patients that are transmitting the disease are currently not diagnosable. The only way to remedy this blind spot, to contain and further prevent pandemic diseases before a vaccine is available, is a new type of test that is mobile, fast, cheap, lab-independent and accurate. The possibility to test large parts of the population at home, avoiding high costs and high strain for the healthcare system, will significantly contribute to immediate containment of such diseases and prevention of the loss of lives, without the need for counter measures that cause large economic damage such as ones we are currently experiencing. Within this proposed project, the group of Prof. Vörös (ETH Zürich), who is leading this project, will develop a rapid test system based on lateral flow assays, with drastically improved sensitivity, while maintaining the point-of-need principle (i.e. rapid turn-around time and immediate availability of the test result). With this test, a clinical sensitivity of close to 100% for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal or throat swab samples seems likely. Our group will then benchmark this technology with real samples against clinically validated methods. The aim of the planned study  is to clinically validate the developed test and determine its performance characteristics compared to the current gold standard [a laboratory-developed, qualitative SARS-CoV-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)] and in two scenarios (professional-collected vs. self-collected swabs). Patients with suspicion of COVID-19 presenting to the outpatient clinic of the University Hospital Basel or having been diagnosed with COVID-19 after admission to the hospital will be asked for participation in this validation study if a SARS-CoV-2 test is deemed necessary by the treating physicians. Additionally, patients with confirmed viral upper or lower respiratory tract infections will be included. This proposed new test is a unique tool with a high potential to dramatically impact the spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19 and to decrease mortality and the high economic burden of pandemic diseases.

During the tenure of the original project, we have broadened the scope of the original research plan by establishing a regular sampling of plankton and CH4 biogeochemistry in another Swiss Lake, Lake Cadagno. During the first 2.5 years of the project, we generated a comprehensive data set that allowed us to answer important questions that we proposed in the parent proposal. Based on results from both lakes, we could demonstrate clear seasonal variability in the magnitude of the lacustrine methane paradox, and establish links between the accumulation of CH4, feeding zooplankton, and the degradation of planktonic detritus. We could experimentally show that CH4 can be produced in oxygenated lake waters from methylated compounds both under nutrient-limited and nutrient-replete conditions. At the same time, we were able to exclude the possibility that the lacustrine ""methane paradox"" in the two studied lakes results from an upwelling or lateral transport of sedimentary gas. Moreover, we were able to prove that aerobic CH4 accumulation varied with different plankton communities, confirming close links to the lacustrine productivity cycle and general limnological conditions. For example, we observed putative links between the development of picocyanobacterial blooms (Synechoccocus), the concentration of dimethylsulfide (DMS, a potential substrate in CH4 formation) in subsurface waters, and the accumulation of CH4, yet, the overall amount of DMS seemed insufficient to fully account for the observed methane paradox. While canonical methanogens are virtually absent from the epilimnetic microbial communities of both lakes (less than 0.05% of OTUs), methylotrophic bacteria as well as photoautotrophs are abundant, and are potentially capable of exploiting methylated nutrients (methylphosphonate - MPn, methylamines-MA). In fact, the most recent set of incubation experiments within SNSF project 3623910 supported that both methylphosponate (MPn) and methylamine (MA) are suitable substrates for CH4 generation in oxic waters of the studied lakes. Most importantly, and in contrast to literature reports, the production of CH4 was not inhibited by inorganic phosphorous (as PO43-P), indicating that P-limitation is not a pre-requisite for the exploitation of methylated P to occur in nature. Although the data so far are highly promising and provide a solid basis for at least three publications, not all of the questions originally posed could be addressed unambiguously (due to the highly complex nature of analytical techniques required to identify and quantify natural concentrations of methylated P and N compounds, as well as molecular characterization of DOM). Specifically, uptake of MPn and/or MA in the context of lacustrine aerobic CH4 production, the identity of the microbes/algae involved, and the specific role of picocyanobacteria still needs further investigation. Given the comprehensiveness and great variety of data already generated, the project extension will provide the time required for a more in-depth statistical analysis and exploitation of the already existing data set. In addition, we propose complementary bio-geochemical analyses of samples that have already been collected during past samplings to confirm the robustness of existing results (characterization of DOM by FTIR-ICMS, characterization and quantification of polysaccharide esters of phosphonic acids by NMR and methylated amines by solid-phase microextraction techniques), as well as incubation experiments with 13C labelled MPn and 15N labelled MA to assess uptake and metabolism of these compounds by isolated Synechoccocus strains using isotope-ratio mass-sepctrometry and NanoSims imagining. Prime objective of the project extension will be to establish whether, and to what extend, the exploitation of dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) and methylated-N compounds occurs naturally under different trophic conditions, and what the potential rates of CH4 generation are. We will also investigate further the C isotopic fingerprint (including clumped CH4 isotope signatures) of MPn or MA-based aerobic methane production. This project extension thus promises to provide additional milestones in our efforts to understand the ""methane paradox"" in lakes, helping us to gain insight into the biogeochemical controls on global CH4 emissions from aquatic environments.",NA,external_funding,Active,4596558,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,628,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Methods We will set up a trial platform which will be implemented and nested into the Swiss HIV Cohort Study and the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study to investigate during a new epidemic the comparative effectiveness of immediate and preventive therapy with emerging antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. Patients in these cohorts with mild SARS-CoV-2 infection with no pneumonia and SARS-CoV-2 negative patients at risk for complicated infection due to age, HIV (&lt;350-500 CD4 cells/µl), solid organ transplantation or with risk factors for COVID-19 pneumonia who consent to participate in the trial will be randomised to candidate antivirals. The primary composite endpoint is CT-confirmed pneumonia, hospitalization or death from any cause. Need for immediate hospitalization for any reason is an exclusion criteria. Based on accumulating evidence of ongoing and published trials of antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 infection, patients will be randomized in the presence of one active drug to drug A versus control, in the presence of two drugs to drug A or B or control.

In nuclear medicine, radiolabeled molecules can specifically target such cell surface receptors and can be shaped for blending diagnostic and therapeutic within the same molecule (radio-theranostics). Recently, an endogenous antagonist of CXCR4, termed EPI-X4, has been identified by the applicants. EPI-X4 is a 16-mer peptide derived from human serum albumin that specifically binds CXCR4 but no other G-protein coupled receptors, without causing receptor activation. Several synthetic derivatives of EPI-X4 with increased affinity for CXCR4, resistance against proteolytic degradation in blood and high systemic retention times have been developed. Radiotheranostics based on EPI-X4 may thus offer new imaging tests and therapeutic options to patients suffering from CXCR4-expressing malignancies. The proposed research project would be the first study aiming to evaluate a new class of radiopharmaceuticals based on an endogenous peptide naturally present in the human body, which may have less off-target effects as compared to small molecules. Overall objectives: a) to develop a new radiotheranostic agent based on EPI-X4 for non-invasive molecular imaging and targeted radionuclide therapy of CXCR4-expressing malignancies, b) to identify the strengths and limitation of this radiotheranostic agent in vivo in comparison to existing CXCR4-radioligands, and c) to explore the clinical applicability of this new class of radiopharmaceuticals. Specific Aims: a) to synthesize and characterize a series of EPI-X4-based radioligands with high affinity for CXCR4, b) to evaluate them in vitro and in vivo in cancer cells and animal models, c) to optimize the radioligands in terms of affinity, biodistribution and pharmacokinetics, and d) to identify the radiotheranostic agent that fulfils the requirements for potential clinical translation. Methodology: Selected EPI-X4 derivatives will be C-terminally conjugated to the chelator DOTA and labeled with 68Ga for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and with 177Lu for targeted radionuclide therapy. All radioligands will be characterized and screened in vitro for receptor recognition, affinity, and CXCR4 antagonism using cell lines with different receptor expression levels. The ligands that successfully pass these tests will be evaluated in vivo in CXCR4-expressing xenografts, including PET and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging, biodistribution, stability and pharmacokinetics. In vitro and in vivo data will be analysed for structure optimization. Comprehensive in vivo assessment and dosimetry studies will be performed with the best candidates. Expected results: The work covers the full spectrum of pre-clinical radiopharmaceutical development, from the design, evaluation, optimization and establishment of a new class of radiotheranostics for CXCR4-expressing malignancies. Based on this work, selection of a lead compound suitable for clinical translation will be possible. Also, it will provide key data that are required for submission of a regulatory dossier to national authorities and initiate a first-in-man study. Impact: This new class of radiotheranostics may offer new diagnostic and treatment options for various CXCR4-expressing malignancies, based on non-invasive and personalized selection of patients and subsequent CXCR4-targeted radionuclide therapy of potential responders. In addition, CXCR4 PET may be used as a prognostic imaging biomarker, as increased CXCR4 expression in tumors is associated with worse prognosis.

Our laboratory has a long-standing interest in the molecules and mechanisms regulating growth and development of Purkinje cell dendrites. We have identified Protein Kinase C (PKC) activity as a major regulator of Purkinje cell dendritic growth. Protein kinase C is also linked to SCA-14, a hereditary cerebellar disease which is characterized by cerebellar dysfunction and Purkinje cell degeneration and which is caused by point mutations or deletions in the PKC? gene. The mechanisms by which the mutations in the PKC? gene lead to Purkinje cell dysfunction in SCA-14 are still not known. We have generated a transgenic mouse model with a SCA-14 mutation located in the catalytic domain of PKC? (S361G). We could show that the presence of the mutated protein in mouse Purkinje cells induces a striking reduction of Purkinje cell dendritic outgrowth indicating that the mutated protein has constitutive kinase activity and is biologically active in Purkinje cells. The finding of a strongly reduced dendritic growth caused by a mutation from spinocerebellar ataxia has also linked the disturbance of dendritic development of Purkinje cells to the pathogenesis of spinocerebellar ataxias. The Purkinje cell-specific expression of the S361G mutation has allowed us to use this this mouse model for identifying molecules which are transcriptionally regulated in Purkinje cells carrying this mutation and which might be involved in the signaling mechanisms eventually resulting in the reduction of dendritic growth. As a first candidate molecule we have identified Car8 as a potential mediator of PKC signaling. Further work in our group has now identified more potential candidate molecules which have an altered expression in S361G Purkinje cells, which might interact directly or indirectly with PKC? and which are linked to PKC? signaling. Besides Car8, these include the IP3 receptor 1 (IP3R1), the Plasma membrane calcium ATPase 2 (PMCA2), the Collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) and the Inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase (InPP5a). Two more candidate molecules have been identified on the basis of their transcriptional regulation not only in SCA14 but also in two other forms of spinocerebellar ataxia, these are the serine/threonine kinase 17b (STK17b) and the regulator of G- protein signaling RGS8. We have by now shown for all the mentioned candidate molecules that they are expressed in Purkinje cells and that their expression is changed in the S361G mouse model. The major aim of this project is to better define the interaction of these molecules with PKC? and their role for PKC signaling, Purkinje cell dendritic development and Purkinje cell dysfunction in spinocerebellar ataxia.

"Hostettler Haack, Katrin Esther",NA,Departement Biomedizin / Pulmonary Cell Research (Roth/Tamm),Fibrosis-specific lung progenitor cells: Role and therapeutic potential in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,2020,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare, chronic, and irreversible interstitial lung disease characterized by a progressive loss of lung function, limited therapeutic options and high mortality. The pathomechanism of IPF remains incompletely understood, but repetitive injuries to the alveolar epithelium and disturbed wound healing with delayed re-epithelialization seem to play a critical role in the development of this deleterious disease. These processes induce an enhanced proliferation of mesenchymal cells and their increased deposition of extracellular matrix proteins in the lung interstitium, finally leading to progressive fibrosis (Selman M; Ann Intern Med 2001). Taking into account the limited efficacy of current anti-fibrotic treatments, new therapeutic approaches should focus on the alveolar epithelium and its injury repair capacities. Recently we have demonstrated the presence of stem cell-like cells in the peripheral lung parenchyma of patients with IPF (Gazdhar A et al. PlosONE 2013; Hostettler KE et al. PlosOne 2017) . The secretome of these lung-resident stem cell-like cells exerted significant anti-fibrotic effects in vitro (Hostettler KE et al. PlosOne 2017) and in vivo (Khan P et al; manuscript submitted). Single cell RNA-sequencing characterizes the cells as cytokeratin 5-positive epithelial progenitor cells (KRT5+PC) with a subset of these progenitor cells co-expressing mesenchymal markers. Overall Objectives: The objectives of this project are to further investigate the characteristics, function and capacities of KRT5+PC in vitro and in vivo and thus study their function and their role in the pathogenesis of IPF. We hypothesize that strategies involving the use of KRT5+PC and/or their products for future treatment of IPF may be a promising approach. The results of this project will add knowledge towards strategies involving the use of lung-derived epithelial progenitor cells for future treatments in IPF patients. Specific Aims/Methods: This project is based on the in vitro culture of primary human peripheral lung-derived KRT5+PC.

Primary cultures of KRT5+PC will be established. KRT5+PC will be further characterized and their functional and differentiation properties will be studied in vitro by immunofluorescence, RT-PCR, and immunoblotting. The effect of a pro-fibrotic microenvironment on the KRT5+PC will be assessed. (ii) The effect of KRT5+PC in a mouse model for IPF will be studied (Prof. A. Prasse, Hannover, Germany). KRT5+PC will be injected into the mice and engraftment, differentiation state of cells and their effect on mouse lung architecture will be investigated. (iii) The gene expression profile of KRT5+PC obtained from patients with IPF as compared to KRT5+PC from patients with non-IPF fibrotic lung diseases will be studied and compared by RNA sequencing and single cell RNA-sequencing.

"Stahlberg, Henning",NA,Departement Biozentrum / Structural Biology (Stahlberg),Structural Studies of Human Brain in Neurodegeneration,2020,"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is characterized by the presence so-called Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy neurites in affected brain regions. LBs are large intracellular aggregates, for which Spillantini et al. identified the protein alpha-synuclein (aSyn) as a major protein component. We have applied correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) to human post-mortem brain from Parkinson's disease patients, and investigated the structure of Lewy bodies. Contrary to expectations, most LBs that did stain strongly for phosphorylated alpha-synuclein in the light microscope, showed in the electron microscope that they consisted primarily of aggregated membranous material instead of the expected fibrillar content. In parallel, we have determined the atomic structure of in vitro generated alpha-synuclein fibrils by cryo-EM, revealing three different types of atomic structures, termed polymorphs. We here propose to further develop CLEM towards cryo-CLEM, by combining correlative fluorescence light microscopy and cryo-electron microscopy of high-pressure frozen human brain, which would avoid any chemical fixation or heavy-metal staining. This will require developing a protocol to stain human brain prior to high-pressure freezing or sectioning. We will then apply immuno-EM, conventional CLEM, and cryo-CLEM to study human post-mortem brain from patients. We will determine the molecular composition of filamentous structures found in some of the LBs, and investigate the compositions of LBs found in other brain and tissue regions. We will expand our analysis to brain tissue at earlier stages of Parkinson's disease, and study the LB appearance in sporadic, as well as genetically triggered PD variants from patients who suffered from mutations in LRRK2 and GBA. In addition, we will seek to purify aSyn fibrils from human brain of PD patients, and determine their high-resolution structure by cryo-EM. We expect our analysis of earlier disease (Braak) stages to shed light into the chronologic development of Lewy pathology. The analysis of the ultrastructure of the post-mortem brain of PD patients who were affected by LRRK2 or GBA mutations, might give clues about the mechanism of disease development in these frequently occurring inherited forms of PD.

When caregiving in situations of chronic illness, multi-morbidities, acute illness or deterioration of mental health becomes too complex and too time-consuming for private settings, older people in Switzerland and central Europe typically move to nursing homes or other long-term residential care. Accordingly, the necessity of long-term residential care (LTRC) in later life has increased. To tackle caregiving of such a diverse and fragmented older population with complex health situations in LTRC, a widely-suggested recipe of public health institutions, as well as broadly in nursing and health research is a conceptual approach of person-centred care (PCC). PCC inherently requires what in the health sector is loosely summarized under interprofessionality, thus any kind of collaboration between different professional groups (like physiotherapists, general practitioners, registered nurses, nurse assistants, housekeeping staff etc.). Currently, we know little about how in LTRC the rather theoretical concept of PCC is actually put into practice. How do staff and all kind of professionals in LTRC facilities in their everyday practice ""form and foster"" therapeutic and caring relationships between all care providers, patients and others? What are the practices which form and foster PCC? And what are the lived experiences of the professionals in relation to PCC and its inherent interprofessionality? This research project aims at exploring these questions ethnographically in three innovative care homes in Basel-Landschaft (CH), Sheffield (UK) and Maastricht (NL) to better understand and describe what the everyday practices and lived experiences of interprofessionality and person-centered care among professional workers in long-term residential care are and to contrast them with current discourse on recommendations from public health actors. ------------------------------ Interprofessionalität und personenzentrierte Pflege in der stationären Langzeitpflege - Ein ethnographischer Ansatz Die globale Alterung und der damit verbundene steigende Bedarf an Pflege und Betreuung älterer Menschen sind Themen, mit denen wir täglich in den Medien, aber auch in unseren Nachbarschaften und Familien konfrontiert werden. Wenn die Betreuung in Situationen chronischer Krankheit, Multimorbidität, akuter Erkrankung oder Verschlechterung der psychischen Gesundheit für den privaten Rahmen zu komplex und zu zeitaufwendig wird, ziehen ältere Menschen in der Schweiz und in Mitteleuropa typischerweise in Pflegeheime oder andere Langzeitpflegeeinrichtungen um. Dementsprechend hat die Notwendigkeit von stationärer Langzeitpflege im späteren Leben zugenommen. Um die Betreuung einer so vielfältigen und fragmentierten älteren Bevölkerung mit komplexen Gesundheitssituationen in der stationären Langzeitpflege zu bewältigen, wird in öffentlichen Gesundheitseinrichtungen sowie in der Pflege- und Gesundheitsforschung allgemein ein konzeptioneller Ansatz der personenzentrierten Pflege vorgeschlagen. Personenzentrierte Pflege erfordert als Basis, was im Gesundheitssektor unter Interprofessionalität lose zusammengefasst wird, also jede Art der Zusammenarbeit zwischen verschiedenen Berufsgruppen (wie Physiotherapeut*innen, Allgemeinpraktiker*innen, diplomierte Pflegende, Pflegehilfskräfte, Hauswirtschaftspersonal usw.). Derzeit wissen wir wenig darüber, wie in der stationären Langzeitpflege das eher theoretische Konzept der personenzentrierten Pflege tatsächlich in die Praxis umgesetzt wird. Wie ""formen und fördern"" Mitarbeiter*innen und alle Arten von Fachpersonen in Alters-und Pflegeheimen in ihrer täglichen Praxis therapeutische und fürsorgliche Beziehungen zwischen allen Leistungserbringern, Patienten und Angehörigen? Welches sind die Praktiken, die personenzentrierte Pflege bilden und fördern? Und was sind die Erfahrungen der Fachkräfte in Bezug auf personenzentrierte Pflege und die ihr innewohnende Interprofessionalität? Dieses Forschungsprojekt zielt darauf ab, diese Fragen in drei innovativen Pflegeheimen in Basel-Landschaft (CH), Sheffield (UK) und Maastricht (NL) ethnographisch zu erforschen, um besser zu verstehen und zu beschreiben, was die alltäglichen Praktiken und gelebten Erfahrungen von Interprofessionalität und personenzentrierter Pflege unter den Fachkräften in der stationären Langzeitpflege sind, und sie dem aktuellen Diskurs über Empfehlungen von Akteuren des öffentlichen Gesundheitswesens gegenüberzustellen.","long-term care, nursing home, interprofessionality, person-centered care, ethnography, qualitative research",external_funding,Active,4598506,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,635,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

This may be explained by an over-activation of the IL-1beta System. Indeed, metabolic stress (increased glucose and lipid levels) induces NLRP3-mediated IL-1beta secretion. Covid-19 also activates NLRP3. Therefore we hypothesize that metabolic stress in patients with overweight and diabetes potentiates covid-19 induced hyper-inflammatory syndrome leading to excess mortality in these vulnerable patients.Backrgoung:Activation of the innate immune system by IL-1 is apparent at all stages of the development of obesity associated type 2 diabetes and its complications. This includes impaired insulin secretion and sensitivity, cardiovascular diseases and heart failure. Accordingly, IL-1 antagonism has been shown to improve glycaemia, cardiovascular complications, and to reduce hospitalization for heart failure and heart failure-related mortality. The latter is of particular importance in the context of Covid-19, because patients with type 2 diabetes per se are at high risk to develop heart failure with a high mortality rate. Several studies have shown that the corona virus stimulates the NLRP3 inflammasome leading to a severe inflammatory response by the IL-1beta pathway, as reflected by CRP and IL-6 increase. In obese diabetic individuals, metabolic stress also promotes the IL-1ß pathway. Thus we hypothesize that both mechanisms will synergize leading to a deleterious hyper-inflammation as often observed in obese diabetic patients affected by Covid-19.Our hypothesis is supported by several recent studies. Indeed, in a cohort of &gt;7'000 Covid-19 patients, type 2 diabetes was associated with a higher death rate. Supporting our hypothesis that glucose-induced IL-1ß will amplify Covid-19 hyper-inflammation, hyperglycemia correlated with a worse outcome. Most importantly, in a retrospective cohort study of patients with Covid-19, treatment with the IL-1 receptor antagonist IL-1Ra was safe and associated with clinical improvement in 72% of patients.Method:This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy of canakinumab plus standard-of-care compared with placebo plus standard-of-care in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection and type 2 diabetes.A total of 116 patients will be randomized using a 1:1 allocation ratio of which 58 subjects will receive a single intravenous canakinumab infusion and 58 patients will receive a single placebo infusion.",NA,external_funding,Active,4601198,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,638,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"Shafer, Maxwell",NA,Departement Biozentrum / Cell and Developmental Biology (Schier),Exploring sleep ecology and genetics across hyperdiverse African cichlids,2020,"We will explore the hyperdiverse cichlid fishes of Lake Tanganyika as a novel model system to study sleep ecology and genetics. Many of the molecular and neuronal mechanisms that regulate the circadian phase, duration, and structure of sleep are conserved across vertebrates. Given this extensive conservation, it is remarkable that sleep displays extensive variation across and even within species. Species can sleep as little as 2 hrs a day (giraffes), or as much as 20 hrs (bats), they can be active during different times of the day (nocturnal or crepuscular predators) or display place preferences for where they sleep (in nests or burrows). Species-specific variations in sleep features like where and when they sleep, or how long and how frequently they sleep may be adaptive. Changes in sleep, or temporal niche differentiation, could allow exploitation of new ecological niches. Temporal adaptation can allow animals to avoid predators (or encounter prey), or to reduce competition with similar species over resources. However, the genetics and ecology underlying sleep diversity across and within species are largely unknown.Cichlids represent the most extraordinary example of vertebrate explosive speciation - approximately 2000 species have evolved within the last 10 million years in the Rift Valley Lakes of Africa. In these lakes, cichlids have diversified to take up the majority of ecological niches, diversifying in diet, body size, mating behaviours, colouration, and habitat preferences. These ecological adaptations are partially driven by behavioural changes, though no studies to date have examined the role of temporal niche adaptation and sleep in cichlids. We therefore hypothesise that cichlid diversity is a powerful system to uncover the genetic basis of sleep diversity and its connection with ecological diversity.Aim 1: Characterise the natural variation in sleep behaviour and ecology in Lake Tanganyikan cichlids. We will undertake an extensive screen of sleep behaviours across at least 60 of the ~240 cichlid species in Lake Tanganyika. For each species we will determine: the circadian phase of activity (when they sleep), the sleep structure (frequency and duration of sleep bouts), and circadian or state dependent changes in place preference (where they sleep). These characteristics will be correlated with known ecologies for each species. For example, predatory cichlids may have evolved to be active when their prey species are asleep. Other species might migrate between environments, or retreat to the safety of rocky substrates between sleep and wake periods. These studies will reveal whether and how sleep behaviors reflect ecological niches.Aim 2: Determine the genetic architecture of sleep-associated behaviours in Lake Tanganyikan cichlids. Across lakes, cichlids have convergently evolved many traits and are predicted to have done so using similar genetic mechanisms. We hypothesize that shared sleep behaviors evolved through similar genetic changes. From our collaborators we currently have access to whole genome sequences from all of the ~240 species of cichlids in Lake Tanganyika (approximately 1000 total genomes), and brain transcriptomes from 76 species. We will use these resources to perform genome wide association studies (GWAS) to identify genomic variants associated with specific sleep features. These analyses will lay the foundation for future work - we will follow up with high-resolution genetic mapping and molecular characterization of the genes and variants we identify.This project will be the first to explore the remarkable power of the cichlid system to interrogate the mysterious relationships between sleep and ecology, and would establish them as a novel model system to study sleep. Connecting specific sleep behaviors to specific ecological niches would provide fundamental insights into animal behaviors in natural habitats. Linking specific sleep behaviors to genomic loci would help reveal the genetic basis of animal sleep and have potential relevance to the genetics of sleep in humans.",NA,external_funding,Active,4602508,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,639,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"Hevey, Rachel",NA,Departement Pharmazeutische Wissenschaften / Molekulare Pharmazie (Ricklin),Investigation of a novel target for attenuating bacterial infection,2020,"Recent data clearly illustrate the growing threat of infectious pathogens, with nearly 3 million antibiotic-resistant infections recorded annually in the US and 35,000 of these resulting in morbidity. Antibiotic resistance results in failed treatment, prolonged hospital stays, and increases the financial burden placed on the medical system. Therefore, novel approaches to antibiotic use and/or combination therapies are urgently needed. Recent studies have demonstrated a novel role of mucin glycans in attenuating pathogen virulence in several cross-kingdom species, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, and Streptococcus mutans. In a P. aeruginosa porcine burn model, glycan treatment significantly reduced pathogen virulence and increased bacterial susceptibility to host immune defense, thereby indirectly reducing infection load. Based on these observations, a therapeutic molecule which targets the same entity as the mucin glycans would be a promising novel approach to treating infection, and should have a reduced risk of developing resistance as it does not directly affect bacterial survival. This approach to treating infections is highly unconventional as it targets virulence gene regulation rather than pathogen survival. Given that mucins contain hundreds of different O-glycan structures and therefore their individual glycans cannot be purified from native sources, we have been developing a synthetic platform to access a library of O-glycans and have used this to establish several lead compounds. As mucin glycans are not commercially available, this puts us in the unique position of being able to probe individual molecular interactions and elucidate the unique roles of individual glycan structures. Based on these initial lead compounds, we aim to design, synthesize, and evaluate a series of glycomimetic ligands to assess their potential as novel therapeutics. If successful, this would afford the first example of therapeutically using mucin-derived glycomimetics to attenuate pathogen virulence in infection. Given the importance of antibiotic-resistance and novel approaches to treating infection, the attenuation of microbial virulence is a promising therapeutic approach as it renders pathogens more susceptible to host immunity. The proposed project will afford a better understanding of mucin-based glycan interactions with pathogens, and early-generation glycomimetics will represent a first class of therapeutic compounds targeting virulence gene suppression.","antivirulence, glycomimetic, infection, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, lectin",external_funding,Active,4602510,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,640,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

IRD is a major cause of early-onset blindness affecting 350,000 people in Europe. Our group has been involved in the identification of almost 30 percent of the ~260 IRD genes, including major and less prevalent genes, and in the pathogenesis of IRD. These significant advances in the genomic underpinnings of IRD have culminated in novel therapies entering the clinic. Despite this progress, there are important knowledge gaps that hamper a molecular diagnosis in half of the cases. We and others have provided proof-of-concept for an emerging role of non-coding DNA variation in unsolved IRD, affecting splicing or regulation. We demonstrated there is an unmet need for a methodological and conceptual shift from classical coding genomics to integrative omics. Here, it is our main goal to establish a framework to solve missing heritability in IRD using multi-omics and gene editing in human cellular and animal models. First, we will dissect the regulation of IRD genes in human retina to improve functional genome annotation. Second, we will revisit phenotyping and generate relevant cellular models derived from unsolved monoallelic patients with suspected recessive IRD.

"Biondini, Simone",NA,Departement Physik / Theoretische Physik (Antusch),Effective field theory and open quantum system approach for dark matter dynamics in the early universe,2020,"One of the major challenges in cosmology is to understandthe matter content of our universe. According to General Relativity (GR) there are deep connections between what fills the universe and its geometry, its dynamical expansion and eventually its fate. Notably, visible ordinary matter appears to be only a small fraction of the matter in our universe, whereas the bulk comes in the form of non-luminous and non-baryonic particles, dubbed dark matter (DM). Complementary measurements of large scale structures, galaxy formation, gravitational lensing and of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) strongly suggest that more than 80\% of the matter in the universe consists of DM.The most accurate determination for ordinary matter and DM energy density are provided by anisotropies in the CMB and amount to $\Omega_{\hbox{\scriptsize B}} h^2 = 0.02237 \pm 0.00015$ and $\Omega_{\hbox{\scriptsize DM}} h^2 = 0.1200 \pm 0.0012$.On the contrary, there is almost a total lack of information concerning DM fromthe particle physics point of view. Over the last few decades, a Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) has become the most studied candidate for DM. One of its key features is the production mechanism in the early universe via the so-called \textit{freeze-out} of a thermal relic. For a DM particle of mass $M$, the freeze-out occurs at a temperature $T \sim M/25$, i.e. the DM particles are \textit{non-relativistic}. However, the freeze-out mechanism is not limited to WIMPs and even applies to cases where interactions are stronger.The key quantity that governs the evolution of the DM abundance is the thermally averaged annihilation cross section $\langle \sigma v \rangle_{{\rm{ann}}}$, encompassed in a Boltzmann equation\begin{equation}(\partial_t + 3H) n = -\langle \sigma v \rangle_{{\rm{ann}}} (n^2-n^2_{{\rm{eq}}}) \, ,\label{Boltzmann_1}\end{equation} where $H$ is the Hubble rate and $n$ is the total number density of DM particles ($n_{{\rm{eq}}}$ is that in equilibrium). The value of $\langle \sigma v \rangle_{{\rm{ann}}}$ depends on the model under consideration, namely its particle content and interactions. It is extremely important to calculate $\langle \sigma v \rangle_{{\rm{ann}}}$ accurately because the predicted present-day DM energy density depends crucially on it through the solution of eq.~(\ref{Boltzmann_1}). The DM mass is in turn fixed as function of the other model parameters to reproduce $\Omega_{\hbox{\scriptsize DM}} h^2$ in the first place (e.g.~couplings, mass splitting with other dark species). However, determining $\langle \sigma v \rangle_{{\rm{ann}}}$ by including the full features of each model and the thermal environment is not an easy task. In a variety of theories, DM interacts with gauge bosons or scalars that induce long-range interactions because of repeated soft exchanges. Remarkably, the inclusion of bound-state effects for DM annihilation has been recently shown to have a large impact on the \textit{overclosure bound} for DM models, namely the largest value of the particle mass compatible with the observed DM energy density. At the same time, it is manifestly subtle and complicated to include bound-state dynamics in a thermal medium due to the intricate interplay between non-relativistic and thermal energy scales. The overall objective of the project is to develop and apply a novel approach for relic density computations in the framework of non-relativistic effective field theories (NREFTs) and open quantum systems (OQSs). Starting from a thermal field theoretic formulation of the problem, the interactions between the DM and the light plasma constituents will systematically be included: \textit{bound-state formation and dissociation}, Sommerfeld effect, DM thermal masses and interaction rates, and the role of \textit{phase transitions} during the freeze-out process. I will provide the DM annihilation cross sections and overclosure bounds for well-motivated classes of models: DM coannihilating with strongly interacting states (QCD-like), DM embedded in spontaneously broken Abelian and non-Abelian gauge gauge theories, composite DM. To this aim cutting-edge effective field theory (EFT) techniques at finite temperature will be used, in particular NREFTs and potential NREFTs (pNREFTs). Moreover, DM particles in medium will be recast in an open-quantum-system framework for the first time, with a focus on DM bound-state formation and their in-medium evolution. By adopting and exploiting such methods, the corresponding overclosure bounds on the DM mass will serve as comprehensive and solid benchmarks to interpret and guide experimental analyses for a wide class of DM models. In the contemporary endeavour of testing and possibly falsifying WIMP-like models with present and upcoming experiments, the outcomes of this project are timely and necessary in order to deliver the most reliable relic density constraints on the models parameters, especially on the DM mass.",NA,external_funding,Active,4512350,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,642,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"Matter, Matthias",NA,Bereich Querschnittsfächer (Klinik) / Pathologie USB,The role of the inflammatory microenvironment in liver cancer development,2020,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide with a fast growing incidence in the USA and Europe. HCC develops mostly in the context of chronic liver inflammation, mainly due to alcoholic and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and chronic infection with hepatitis C or B virus. Chronic liver inflammation causes continuous liver damage with progressive liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, which may eventually lead to HCC. Whereas the ten-year incidence for HCC in patients with chronic inflammation and cirrhosis is approximately 20%, many cirrhotic patients remain tumor-free for their entire lives. The reasons why certain cirrhotic patients develop HCC, whereas others remain tumor-free, are poorly understood. Therefore, one of the main research axis in my laboratory is to clarify the mechanisms defining the different outcomes of chronic liver inflammation. We designed a longitudinal study with formalin fixed and paraffin embedded liver biopsy samples from several Swiss Pathology Services. In a preliminary project, we examined the mRNA expression of genes associated with cancer development and the miRNA expression by the nCounterNanoString technology. The expression profiles in matched longitudinal samples of non-tumoral liver tissue from patients developing HCC (n = 30) was analyzed before and after HCC formation in the same patient. Cirrhotic patients (n = 27) remaining tumor-free within a similar time frame served as a control cohort. Comparison of the two cohorts revealed that liver tissues from patients developing HCC displayed profound changes from the 1st to the 2nd biopsy and in comparison to patients remaining tumor-free. In particular, patients developing HCC showed activation of NF-?B, Insulin receptor and PI3K-AKT pathways, in parallel with increased hepatocyte proliferation and damage. Furthermore, downregulation of miR-579-3p was found as an early step in HCC development, and we identified miR-579-3p as a gate keeper of PI3K-AKT signaling pathway activation. Based on our promising results, the first aim of this project is to deepen our analysis and investigate the functional role of additional miRNAs changing significantly in patients developing HCC by executing in vitro and in vivo experiments. The second aim is to scrutinize the inflammatory microenvironment in the non-tumoral liver tissue and follow changes in patients developing HCC in comparison to patients remaining tumor-free. Indeed, several evidences indicate that immunosurveillance is an important player in preventing HCC development and is promoted by cells from the innate and the adaptive immune system as well as cytokines and chemokines. To this end, we will perform a systems biology approach and analyze mRNA expression in our tissue samples by performing a multiplex gene expression analysis using the nCounterNanoStringPanCancer Immune Profiling Panel that contains 770 genes involved in immune responses and inflammation. This analysis will allow us to identify immune cell populations and detect changes of genes involved in immune responses. Moreover, we will take a multiplex immunofluorescence approach using the CODEX technology. This novel technique is a high-parameter tissue proteomics multiplexing technology that allows tissue in-situ cytometry with more than 50 parameters on the same tissue slide. Analysis of the patient samples with this approach will allow the identification of different immune subtypes and their spatial interactions within the liver tissue, and facilitate the assignment of the different cell types to anatomical liver compartments. To our best knowledge, a longitudinal study, following liver biopsy samples from patients over several years developing HCC has never been performed. Overall, we believe that our longitudinal study will increase our understanding of the initial steps in HCC development and will help to identify early-on patients at risk for HCC development, allowing specific therapeutic management",NA,external_funding,Active,4514638,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,643,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

The overarching research question for the conceptual laboratory is the following: how can mid-level concepts developed in the Global South be made useful for knowledge production in general? The key critical theoretical assumption underlying the methodological level is the idea that we need to reverse the gaze, i.e. deploy conceptualisations developed in the South in the North. On a substantive level, we ask how useful the mid-level concepts ""re-tribalisation"", ""political society"" and ""the cunning state"" are in describing, analysing and interpreting these crisis phenomena in liberal democracies of Europe (in comparison to already existing conceptual vocabularies developed in a European context), more specifically in the Alpine region (Switzerland, Austria and Italy)? On a theoretical level, we ask how freeing such concepts from the constraints of context can contribute to particular relational approaches to area studies (and disciplinary comparison). Finally, on a methodological level, we seek to draw lessons from the conceptual laboratory in operationalizing an epistemological practice of reciprocal comparison. We propose three empirical case studies which meet two main goals. On the one hand, they seek to offer innovative and conceptually out-of-the-box perspectives on and across the cases themselves, differing from those derived and developed exclusively within and against a European background. Moreover, they draw respectively from an old concept (""retribalisation"", Africa), a fashionable but contested concept (""political society"", Asia) and an emerging concept that still needs to establish itself in the area studies domain (""the cunning state"", Asia). Second, we approach the concepts as descriptions of the set of particulars making up crisis phenomena in specific settings. The question we ask is whether the particulars brought into view can help us shed more light on similar phenomena in Europe, thereby shifting the case for conceptual regionalism in favour of greater attention to the possibilities of comparison. These different histories of the concepts provide us with a diversity of mid-range concepts whose application in other empirical contexts beyond their area studies domain can be tested. Crucial to the research approach is the distinction between the object of research and the scope of inquiry. The former refers to the ""Southern"" background of the deployed concepts and the three case studies in the Alpine region within which empirical research takes place. The latter refers to the concrete phenomenon we describe, analyse and interpret in a given setting. Our project proposal is thus a response to recent critical reflections on Area Studies, comparative disciplinary work, as well as critiques from the South. In building on these literatures while attending to knowledge production in practice, its scholarly outcomes include potentially new perspectives on comparison; a critical engagement with ""universal"" concepts and the politics of conceptual travel; and practical visions on how to imbue the pursuit of knowledge with a concern for ethical and political issues raised by these critiques.","Political Society, Interdisciplinarity, Post-Comparison, Retribalization, Conceptual Analysis, Comparison, Cunning state, Southern Epistemologies, Area Studies",external_funding,Active,4599078,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,644,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Similarity lies at the heart of many higher-order cognitive processes such as categorization and judgments. To date, however, the mechanisms by which people represent similarity in judgment and decision making are not well understood. Past research has traditionally followed the Euclidean view on similarity, assuming that the similarity of objects is a function of their differences on the features which constitute the objects. However, the Euclidean similarity has several limitations, including that it treats features separately and is insensitive to correlations among features, whereas people can be sensitive to correlated features. Therefore, further research is needed to uncover how people represent similarity. Main research question and aim. I argue for a multifaceted view on similarity, which emphasizes that the psychology of similarity comprises multiple useful cognitive similarity mechanisms beyond the Euclidean similarity. My thesis will develop the multifaceted view in four connected theoretical and empirical lines of work, aiming at understanding the processes of psychological similarity representation in higher-order cognition. Projects. Project 1 reviews the success and limitations of the Euclidean similarity in cognitive psychology and how machine learning can enrich current psychological theories. In the remaining three projects, I empirically test new hypotheses derived from the multifaceted view on similarity.

Many current technologies are based on rare and expensive noble metal catalysts. Transition metal phosphides and the biomimetic transition metal chalcogenides are promising earth-abundant replacements for noble metal catalysts in many processes. These binary materials (MnXm) show promise for catalytic water splitting and hydrotreating, but have barely been explored in catalysis for fine-chemical synthesis. The stability, conductivity, and promising catalytic properties of MnXm suggest that there is a plethora of catalysis and electrocatalysis yet to be discovered. Due to their binary composition, MnXm surfaces will likely exhibit complementary selectivity compared to conventional metal catalysts. The high potential for novel catalysis with these binary materials is highlighted by my recent work, in which we discovered the catalytic activity of cobalt phosphide in alkyne hydrogenation. My work also gives unprecedented fundamental insight into the interfacial chemistry and thermochemistry of cobalt phosphide and provides a roadmap to study other binary materials. The goal of the proposed research program is to develop MnXm materials as catalysts for complex chemistry and added-value chemical products. The aim is to survey catalysis of reductive and oxidative transformations with MnXm, starting with hydrogenation reactions. The catalytic properties of MnXm will be tuned by chemical surface modifications. The rational development of MnXm as catalysts will rest on fundamental studies of structure, thermochemistry, and interfacial reactivity of the operative surfaces on a molecular-level. This will be achieved by spectroscopic surface characterization, especially in-situ surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy, stoichiometric equilibration reactions with selected reagents, and parallel study of anchored molecular analogues. The combination of catalytic survey and catalyst tuning,with the underlying fundamentals, will be a powerful approach to reveal novel catalysis by transition metal phosphides and chalcogenides with properties and selectivity thatare currently unattainable for metal catalysts.

"Abiko, Layara Akemi",NA,Departement Biozentrum / Structural Biology (Grzesiek),Functional dry cavities in proteins,2020,"The interior of experimentally determined protein structures often contains cavities, which are not filled by protein atoms. Such cavities are generally thought to be filled by water. However, in few proteins completely empty voids, devoid of any water molecules have been detected by X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. The most recent example is a 141 Å3-sized, dry pocket in thermolysin, which was unambiguously detected by high-resolution X-ray crystallography using an absolute-scale electron density map (Krimmer et al. JACS 2017, 139, 30, 10419-10431). This hydrophobic cavity could then be filled by noble gases as also detected by X-ray crystallography. These observations are limited to a few model systems, and it is unclear how abundant dry voids are in proteins, and whether such voids are connected to protein function and structural stability.Such a functional role may exist in the medically highly relevant G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which constitute the most abundant class of membrane proteins in the human genome. Indeed, a recent study on the ß1-adrenergic receptor (ß1AR, Warne et al. Science 2019, 364, 775-778) showed that its extracellular ligand binding pocket shrinks by 20-40% upon activation by an intracellular G protein mimic. This compression of the ligand pocket explains the affinity increase of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) for agonist ligands in their G protein-bound state. From the 2.8 Å-resolution crystal structure, it remained unclear to what extent the extracellular ligand binding cavity is filled by water. However, a recent pressure NMR study (Abiko et al. JACS 2019, 141, 42, 16663-16670) showed quantitatively that the same receptor experiences a volume reduction of ~100 Å3 upon transition to the active state. This shrinking can only be explained by the collapse of empty, non-hydrated cavities, but the location of these empty cavities remained unknown from the NMR study.We hypothesize that the external ligand pocket of ß1AR is at least partially empty and that this void plays a crucial role in GPCR activation. We propose to determine the location of these empty cavities by X-ray crystallography. In contrast to previous studies, we will incubate the crystals of ß1AR in different functional states at mild pressures with xenon. If empty hydrophobic cavities are present, they should incorporate xenon, which is then easily located in the electron density by its high scattering power.These experiments may reveal the first dry pocket in a membrane protein and connect its existence to a crucial function in GPCRs. More generally, such a proof of existence may establish dry voids as a new interaction principle in proteins. Thus, dry pockets may serve as structural motifs that confine protein movements during folding and function or which specifically recognize distinct hydrophobic moieties of a ligand. This may have major implications on protein folding research, the structure-based explanation of protein function, and the development of new drugs.",NA,external_funding,Active,4602504,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,653,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"Hunziker, Sabina",NA,Bereich Medizinische Fächer (Klinik) / Medizin-Kommunikation (Hunziker),Revision: Checklist-guided shared decision-making for code status discussions in medical inpatients A cluster-randomized multicenter trial,2020,"A patients' decision regarding ""Do Not Resuscitate"" (DNR) code status, which is a legal order to withhold cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or advanced cardiac life support in respect of a patient's wish in case of a cardiac arrest or respiratory failure, has important medical and socioeconomic consequences. Yet, hospitalized patients often have insufficient information about expected outcomes from resuscitation measures. Research shows that &lt;20% of in-hospital patients, who require CPR survive and subsequently many have permanent brain damage or disability. Although challenging in clinical routine, sharing information about expected prognosis with patients is a prerequisite for informed decision-making. In a recent hospital-based survey we found that DNR discussions are often insufficient with physicians not actively involving patients in the decision-making process, but relying decisions on the presumed preferences without in-depth discussions of patients' choices and consequences. General aim: This trial is designed to investigate whether checklist-guided shared decision-making including decision aids and communication of expected outcome influences patients' decision regarding DNR code status, and at the same time, improves decision-making quality as judged by patient's decisional comfort, patient knowledge and involvement in decision-making and patient satisfaction. Patient population: Consecutive adult medical patients admitted for in-hospital care, independent of medical diagnosis are eligible. Patients unable to complete questionnaires or unable to follow code status discussions (e.g., due to cognitive impairment such as dementia or delirium) are excluded. Methods: multicenter, cluster randomized controlled trial involving five Swiss university hospitals.Intervention: Medical residents conducting code status discussions will be randomized by an electronic, web-based system to the intervention group with shared decision-making facilitated by a checklist and a decision aid or to the usual care group. The decision aid was developed during a consensus conference, in which feedback from patients and clinicians was sought and integrated, and later field-tested until thematic saturation was achieved. Intervention group residents will receive detailed instructions about the shared decision-making checklist with specific communication teachings. To reduce bias, control group residents will also receive information about the importance of code status discussions and a general communication training, but no teaching regarding shared decision-making and no checklist will be used.Endpoints: The primary outcome is the frequency of DNR code status among patients per resident (i.e., patients choosing that CPR and intubation measures should not be performed in case of acute deterioration). Our key secondary endpoint is the quality of decision-making as judged by patient's decisional comfort assessed through the validated German translation of the Decision Conflict Scale. Additionally, we will investigate patient`s knowledge about resuscitation measures and expected outcome, patients' involvement in the shared decision-making process assessed through the validated German translation of the SDM-q-9 questionnaire, patients' concerns and fears and overall satisfaction with the code status discussion, as well as physicians perceived comfort with patient's choice and satisfaction with code status discussion. At hospital discharge, we will assess length of hospital stay, ICU-admissions, in-hospital resuscitations, code status violations and in-hospital deaths through medical chart review. Sample size and statistics: Based on pilot data in this patient population, we expect that 30% of patients in the usual care control will have a DNR code status, which will increase to 45% in the intervention group. We plan to include 174 residents (cluster) with a mean of 5 eligible patients per week over a 3-week period (total of 15 patients per cluster) in the five participating centers over a total study time of 2 years. Based on these assumptions, we aim to include 2610 patients among 174 residents, which will give this study an 80% power at a 0.05 alpha error with an inter-cluster correlation of 0.5.Discussion: Although code status discussions are a cornerstone of patient-centered care, there is a lack of trials investigating the most appropriate approach for physicians to communicate with patients about their preference. This multicenter randomized-controlled trial will close this important knowledge gap by systematically investigating effects of checklist-guided shared decision-making on patients' decisions regarding DNR status and the quality of decision-making.",NA,external_funding,Active,4596542,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,654,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

By means of this ""greening,"" religions can contribute significantly to environmental sustainability: they can spread pro-environmental worldviews and values to their members, advocate for environmental protection in the public, and undertake environmental projects (e.g., energy-efficient refurbishments, recycling). Although the topic has increasingly received attention in recent years, there is still little expertise about religious environmentalism at the congregational level. While research has more strongly addressed the membership level (e.g., environmental attitudes of followers of particular religions), only few studies tackle religious environmentalism at the congregational level. Yet, research at the congregational level is particularly important, given that congregations constitute important brokers of environmental engagement between the macro-level (e.g., leadership/religious experts) and the micro-level of a given religion (i.e., members). Congregations can disseminate ""green"" theologies and environmental programs, which the leadership initiated, among the local membership (""top-down greening""). Vice versa, congregations can promote religious grass-roots initiatives, which started at the local congregational level, towards the leadership (""bottom-up greening"") or expand them towards other local congregations (""horizontal greening"").

This ability is a crucial prerequisite for several science disciplines and involves an understanding how distances in two different-sized spaces relate to each other. Given this importance, it seems timely to increase our knowledge about the mental processes involved in spatial scaling; however, several methodological preconditions have to be fulfilled to systematically investigate this skill. As of today, only few studies have addressed these constraints and revealed heterogenous findings. In the present project, we will incorporate these methodological preconditions and qualify previous research by investigating the cognitive processes involved when scaling up (e.g., when interpreting a small-scaled map) and scaling down (e.g., when understanding a large-scaled cell-model), which will probe the flexibility of the scaling process. Furthermore, we aim to extend our knowledge about scaling in the visual domain to the haptic domain and examine in which ways scaling differs between these perceptual modalities. These questions will be investigated in samples of children aged 6, 7, and 8 years as well as adults, which will enable to detect developmental continuity of spatial-scaling abilities in general and effects of perceptual modalities and scaling directions in particular. Using a state-of-the-art methodology, in each of these experiments, children and adults will be presented with two embossed graphics. One graphic will include a convex target location (i.e., the map) and the other one will be empty (i.e., the referent space). Sizes of the maps will differ in accordance to different scaling factors and directions whereas the referent space will be constant in size. Participants will be instructed to visually, haptically, or bimodally explore the map and to remember the target location. Immediately afterwards, they will be asked to indicate the same location in the referent space from memory. The tactile exploration of maps and scaling of spatial information will be additionally investigated in a sample of blind individuals who did collect a varying extent of visual experience in their previous life (congenitally blind and late blind individuals). Investigating the influence of visual experience on spatial-scaling abilities will inform debates discussing whether humans need visual input to generate and transform mental object representations. Furthermore, our results will inform interventions designed to improve blind individuals' usage of embossed graphics. As a final goal, we aim to investigate associations between spatial-scaling abilities and cognitive style, which is a general heuristic how individuals perceive, structure, and remember information. Investigating this relationship will help to understand how trait-like spatial-scaling abilities differ as a function of state-like cognitive styles, which will be central for creating effective training studies and will inform theoretical frameworks. Findings from the proposed studies will make an important contribution to various interdisciplinary fields such as psychology, philosophy, educational sciences, and computer sciences.","spatial scaling, visual domain, tactile domain, cognitive style, blindness, cognitive development, mental transformation",external_funding,Active,4596723,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,656,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a betacoronavirus responsible for the acute illness termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In light of the recent pandemic, a critical question relates to whether a primary SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to immunological memory able to confer long-term immunity to re-infection.Hypothesis. We hypothesize that protective immunity can form following SARS-CoV-2 infection, but its generation is influenced by disease severity (and thus antigen load) during primary infection. COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic infection to patients developing severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. In our COVID-19 cohort (n = 181 as of 22 May 2020, recruitment ongoing), we recently found that SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgG antibody responses correlated significantly with disease severity (Cervia et al. bioRxiv 2020). We submit that mild versus severe SARS-CoV-2 infection exerts quantitative and tissue-specific differences in T and B cell stimulation during primary infection, which in turn lead to significant qualitative differences in terms of protective long-term immunity.Specific aims. This hypothesis shall be tackled within the following two aims:Aim 1 - Primary SARS-CoV-2 infection: In our well-characterized COVID-19 cohort, we will assess the immune response to primary SARS-CoV-2 infection in mild versus severe COVID-19 cases. Using 80-parameter mass cytometry, we will characterize the ex vivo innate and adaptive immune response. 30-40-color spectral flow cytometry will enable us to study phenotypic and functional properties of SARS-CoV-2 peptide pentamer-specific CD8+ T cells, which will be complemented by single cell RNA sequencing and proteogenomic approaches. SARS-CoV-2-specific B cells will be assessed using enzyme-linked immunospot assays and flow cytometry. We will also determine SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM, IgA and IgG titers in sera and mucosal fluids and conduct SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays to functionally assess these antibodies. Using SARS-CoV-2 peptides, we will stimulate antigen-specific T cells to assess their cytokine production, proliferation and cytotoxicity.Aim 2 - Immunity: We will determine the above-mentioned properties of SARS-CoV-2-specific T and B cells at 6 and 12 months after primary SARS-CoV-2 infection in our entire cohort. Moreover, we will monitor our cohort for clinical signs of upper respiratory tract infection and, if suspected, perform sampling of respiratory mucosa to assess SARS-CoV-2 by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. In subjects with proven SARS-CoV-2 re-infection, we aim to sequence the viral genome for signs of immune escape and perform the aforementioned tests to elucidate the status of SARS-CoV-2-specific T and B cells. Lastly, by using computing-intensive mathematical algorithms, we will identify the kinetics and determinants of protective SARS-CoV-2 immunity.Expected results and impact. Our project will provide insights into the phenotypic and functional properties of SARS-CoV-2-specific T and B cells during the primary immune response and the memory phase in mild versus severe COVID-19 cases.

Yet, the results are inconclusive. Most model formulations do not directly incorporate interactions between climatic changes, malaria interventions and socioeconomic effects, which are likely to influence the disease burden in the future. This is partly explained by the scarcity of quality, long-term malaria data. There are a few health and demographic surveillance systems (HDSS) in Africa that routinely collect data on malaria incidence and mortality, malaria interventions, vector densities and household-related indicators. These HDSS offer unique platforms for modelling the spatio-temporal interactions between the climatic and non-climatic factors on the disease burden. Strengthening model-based disease surveillance for forecasting outbreaks will enhance preparedness to the impacts of climate change. Mathematical malaria transmission models are increasingly used for evaluating the effects of control interventions on disease dynamics. However, our knowledge about their forecasting potentials for early warning compared to purely statistical models is limited. Microbial larviciding is an environmentally-driven intervention however it is unclear how climatic factors influence its effectiveness.The overarching goal of the project is to deepen our understanding of the effects of climate change on the burden of malaria and to innovate methods which strengthen disease surveillance and climate adaptation.

The overwhelming majority of studies in higher eukaryotes have focused on phosphorylation of just 3 amino acid residues: serine, threonine and tyrosine. While phosphorylation of these residues is undoubtedly of great importance, recent evidence suggests that non-canonical protein histidine phosphorylation, which is widespread in bacteria, may be of equal importance in eukaryotes. Study of histidine phosphorylation has lagged not because of a lack of intrinsic importance, but due to the extreme heat and acid lability of the phosphohistidine (pHis) phosphoramidate (P-N) bond which precludes the use of standard protein enrichment and analytical methods. However, recent advances in the development of reliable pHis antibodies for immunodetection and immunoprecipitation, coupled with ongoing advances in mass spectrometric methods and analysis, present a window of opportunity for making substantial and rapid progress in this area. We are well poised to seize this opportunity. We have published in the field and have in-house experience working on histidine phosphorylation. Our preliminary results show that pHis may be relevant to other core areas of interest in our laboratory, namely cancer and metabolism. We propose to clarify this potential link using cell and animal models, with the final aim of establishing clinical relevance. We also propose to identify novel substrates of the two known mammalian histidine protein kinases (NME1 and NME2), to add to what is only a handful of currently known histidine-phosphorylated proteins.","Histidine phosphorylation, NME1, LHPP, liver, cancer, metabolism",external_funding,Active,4596567,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,659,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"Goedecker, Stefan",NA,Departement Physik / Physik (Goedecker),Towards Quantifying the Synthesizability of Materials,2020,"The discovery of new materials is an essential ingredient for technological progress. It is generally agreed upon that simulation methods can make important contributions to this field and extensive research activities are under way worldwide. In this context unbiased structure prediction methods have revealed a large number of possible structures for numerous materials. However only a relatively small fraction of these structures can be found in nature or can be synthesized in the laboratory. This observation poses fundamental and technological challenges. One would like to understand whether the unobserved structures can for some hitherto unknown fundamental reason not exist or whether simply the correct synthesis recipe has not yet been found. If they can not exist, synthesis should not be tried for these materials. If they may exist, simulation could give guidance to synthesis efforts. Since a time resolved atomistic simulation of the actual nucleation and growth processes occurring during synthesis is not feasible in connection with a high-accuracy description of the potential energy surface, we will use concepts from thermodynamics to predict the final structure without following the relevant processes in time. In this context, it will be necessary to develop much more efficient methods to calculate free energies. To understand the behavior of the free energy at formation conditions requires developing improved methods to calculate this quantity at high temperatures, where the harmonic approximation breaks down. To obtain the correct energetic ordering at room temperature, it is frequently necessary to include nuclear quantum effects into the free energy calculations. Applying some of the latest mathematical tools, we will develop novel algorithms that are considerably more powerful than the existing ones. Finally we will also search for new quantities that can be obtained from the potential energy surface at affordable numerical cost and that contain relevant information about the synthesizability of a material. All these new methods should then finally allow to directly assess the synthesizability of a material. The new methods will be used for several materials that have potential applications in energy production and storage.

"King, Carolyn",NA,Departement Biomedizin / Immune Cell Biology (King),Deciphering the role of HIF-1alpha in tissue resident T cells during health and disease,2020,"During the last ten years, a population of clonally expanded T cells that take up permanent residence in barrier tissues has been identified. It is increasingly clear that tissue resident memory (TRM) cells play critical roles not only in clearing infection but also in tissue remodeling, repair and protection against subsequent infection. Importantly, the non-circulating status of TRM cells allows them to rapidly respond at the site of antigen exposure, making them an attractive therapeutic target for various immune interventions. We recently identified a novel population of resident T cells that orchestrates humoral immunity in the lung mucosa. Preliminary experiments presented here suggest that HIF1, a transcription factor renowned for it's ability to promote glycolysis and cell survival in oxygen/nutrient poor environments, is gradually upregulated by this subset and stably maintained under homeostatic conditions. The goal of this proposal is to understand how HIF1 activity regulates the generation, survival, localization and function of these cells. We hypothesize that HIF1 acts as a checkpoint for T cell diversification during recall and additionally plays a role in mitigating excessive inflammatory responses that if left unchecked, would destroy the memory T cell niche and/or cause damage to the tissue. We further aim to extend our studies into new disease models where understanding the interplay between HIF1+ and HIF1- TRM cell subsets may have implications for reinvigorating or suppressing T cell responses in tissues and tumors. We have 4 specific aims: Aim 1: Define the signals that induce the generation and maintenance of HIF1+ TRH cells in the lungAim 2: Characterize the spatial localization and immune cell interactions of HIF1+ and HIF1- TRH cells Aim 3: Investigate the impact of HIF1 deletion or stabilization on tissue homeostasis and immunityAim 4: Explore the role of T cell intrinsic HIF expression in antibody mediated allergic disease and cancer",NA,external_funding,Active,4604426,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,661,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"Treutlein, Philipp",NA,Departement Physik / Experimentelle Nanophysik (Treutlein),Non-classical correlations in ultracold atomic ensembles,2020,"Non-classical correlations between quantum systems lead to the most striking departure of quantum from classical physics. Despite decades of research, such correlations still present many conceptual and experimental challenges, while at the same time their key role in quantum technologies is recognised. This is particularly true for systems of many particles, where different classes of non-classical states exist with different usefulness for technological tasks. There are open questions on how to generate, control, detect, and exploit non-classical correlations, in particular in large ensembles where access to individual particles is limited. To elucidate these questions has become a subject of intense research on different experimental platforms.  Ultracold atomic ensembles are quantum many-particle systems par excellence: (1) atoms are very well isolated from the environment and feature long coherence times, (2) ensembles with adjustable atom number from a few hundreds to millions can be reliably generated, (3) a powerful toolbox for control and measurement of their quantum state is available, and (4) atom-atom interactions can be tuned and engineered to generate correlations in a controlled way. These unique features make ultracold atomic ensembles an ideal system for the experimental study of non-classical correlations in many-particle systems, which is the overarching goal of this project. We will use two complementary approaches to pursue this goal: In the first approach, we will investigate atomic two-component Bose-Einstein condensates on an atom chip. Non-classical correlations between the atomic spins are generated by controlled collisions in a state-dependent potential. A specific focus of the experiments will be the distribution of non-classical correlations from one to several spatially separated and individually addressable condensates, with the goal to demonstrate entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering and to investigate schemes for interferometry with spatially split condensates near the atom chip surface. In the second approach we will explore a new scheme for generating non-classical correlations in large atomic spin ensembles based on light-mediated Hamiltonian interactions. Using a new experimental setup with ultracold atoms in an optical dipole trap, we will generate collective spin-spin interactions by multi-pass atom-light interactions with free-space laser beams. This scheme is promising for quantum manipulation of large atomic ensembles in a simple geometry, potentially interesting for precision metrology.

"Spang, Anne",NA,Departement Biozentrum / Biochemistry (Spang),Regulation of endosomal transport and maturation,2020,"Endocytosis is an essential pathway in eukaryotes to receive signals and regulate the protein composition of the plasma membrane. Proteins that are removed from the plasma membrane can either be recycled back, go to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) or be degraded in the lysosome. Inappropriate sorting at endosomes can lead to a variety of cancers, and many factors involved in these processes are oncogenes. In addition, the endosomal pathway is often highjacked by pathogens for their cell entry and infectivity. Moreover, a plethora of other diseases are linked to defects in the endosomal pathway. Therefore, understanding the endosomal pathway is of pivotal importance. Rather than concentrating on a specific disease, we work towards the elucidation of the regulation of the endosomal pathway. This knowledge can then be applied to many instances. Our starting point was the discovery of endosomal maturation. Even though, maturation had been proposed earlier, we were the first to show that endosomes mature from early to late before fusing with the lysosomes. Since then, we have been interested in understanding the regulation and coordination of processes that take place during maturation. Recently, we identified FERARI, a platform on sorting endosomes that recruits Rab11 recycling structures to the sorting endosomes, promotes fusion -without membrane flattening- and then fission of these Rab11 compartments from the sorting endosome. We surmise that during this process cargo destined for recycling is taken up. Thus, we discovered a kiss-and-run mechanism in endocytic recycling. Surprisingly, the residence time of recycling structures on sorting endosomes was quantal in 7 sec intervals, which we interpreted as the time of fusion pore opening and closing. To investigate this unexpected finding further, we propose to (1) determine the structure of FERARI by cryoEM and to reconstitute FERARI function in vitro. (2) to analyse the regulation of FERARI and sorting in vivo using mammalian cell lines and C. elegans as a model animal. (3) In order to better understand the regulation of endosome maturation, we have set up and in vivo assay system in mammalian cells, in which we can enlarge endosome about 40x without harming cells and follow endosome mature with ease under a widefield microscope. We want to explore this unpublished assay (manuscript in preparation) to first describe the coordination of different processes during endosome maturation and then use genetic engineering as well as acute perturbances to understand the regulation of endosome maturation. Thus, we use a balanced mix of high-risk, high-gain parts and very attainable goals to provide unprecedented data on endosomal transport.","C. elegans, structure, tissue culture, small GTPase, microscopy, in vivo assays, intracellular traffic, Rab GTPases, endoscopes, intracellular transport, in vitro assays",external_funding,Active,4604612,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,663,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

It can be caused by the underlying disease, prescribed drugs, or aspecific stimuli such as nausea and pain. Hyponatremia may be life-threatening if it develops acutely and causes cerebral edema with neurological symptoms. The treatment of acute symptomatic hyponatremia is therefore straight forward and implies the administration of hypertonic saline to treat cerebral edema. In contrast, the rationale for treatment of chronic hyponatremia - the most prevalent subtype - is less evident. There are no intervention studies to show that correcting chronic hyponatremia improves outcomes.Importantly, there is increasing data showing an association between chronic hyponatremia and complications such as falls or attention deficit, as well as increased risk of fractures and osteoporosis. It has also been reported that hyponatremia is associated with a poorer prognosis of cardiac, hepatic, kidney and pulmonary diseases as well as the overall outcome of ICU patients resulting in a significant association with an increased mortality and readmission risk. However, it is unclear whether these are merely associations or indicate causality: despite several retrospective analyses showing improvement of readmission and mortality rates, as well as some small uncontrolled studies reporting reduction of adverse events with plasma sodium correction, there is a complete lack of randomized clinical trials investigating whether correction of hyponatremia counteracts the increased risk of readmission and mortality. Thus, there is clinical equipoise on whether chronic hyponatremia should be treated or not. Therefore, the aim of this intervention study is to determine the benefits and harms of a targeted correction of plasma sodium concentration on the combined endpoint 30-day mortality and rehospitalization rate.

Secondary objectives will include: Short- (30 days) and longterm (1 year) risk of death and rehospitalization; other clinical outcomes (neurocognition, quality of life, falls, fractures, length of hospital stay); Safety of the intervention; Exploratory analysis of biomarkers for hyponatremia.

However, we still know little how processing is orchestrated in a temporal and spatial manner, and how this affects gene expression. In recent years, the concept of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) has revolutionized our understanding of molecular processes in cell biology: rapid and regulated formation of membraneless organelles reversibly compartmentalizes cellular components and creates highly dynamic biochemical reaction environments. During my postdoc, I discovered that bacterial, yeast and human RNA-dependent DEAD box ATPases (DDXs), abundant enzymes that chaperone every aspect of RNA life, undergo RNA-dependent LLPS in vitro and are critical regulators of membraneless organelle formation in vivo. These compartments control the accumulation of RNA molecules and selectively enrich for RNA processing factors. Rationale: I postulate that recruitment of RNA into DDX-compartments is a general, novel and conserved mechanism that controls the spatio-temporal flux of mRNA molecules between different steps of maturation and function. Objectives: Chaperoning mRNAs into phase-separated compartments opens up a novel layer of gene expression regulation, and in my future research, I want to study the molecular mechanisms, cellular function and universality of this phenomenon. Specific Aims: I will investigate how formation of two cytoplasmic DDX granules, P-bodies and stress granules, affects mRNA translation and turnover in vivo, and how DDX compartments influence remodelling of RNA-protein complexes in vitro.

EEG has shown great promise in trial stratification, patient monitoring, diagnosis and prognosis of neurodegenerative diseases and diagnosis of mental disorders.The targeted customer groups include researchers, neurologists working in a clinical setting at hospitals or in private practices and institutions or pharmaceutical companies conducting medical trials.According to today's standard, EEG is analyzed visually and findings are reported in free-text format, which results in two major disadvantages: (i) Visual inspection is highly time consuming and dependent on the reviewer profile in terms of experience. Furthermore, visual inspection suffers from low inter-observer agreement. (ii) The free-text format for the reporting of findings is - by definition - non-standardized. As a result, reports are less objective and more difficult to compare.These problems are addressed by combining methods for automated EEG analysis with standardized reporting formats according to recommendations by the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Although these recommendations are not new, their widespread adoption has been slowed as it would not provide time-savings during routine clinical analysis. Nevertheless, several studies show that significant patient benefit occurs when transitioning from free-text reporting to standardized reporting. Important advantages include higher inter-observer agreement, lower number of misdiagnoses and a reduction in unnecessary referrals. As the combination of standardized reporting and automated analysis enables significant time-savings, widespread adoption becomes much more likely.Ultimately, the goal is to provide a cloud-based software-solution for automated EEG analysis and standardized reporting.

To understand the function of the genome, it is not sufficient to know its sequence and local epigenetic features - we must also consider the large-scale physical architecture of entire chromosomes and their positioning within the nucleus. The 3D organization of chromosomes is a key contributor of essential genomic functions, including replication, repair, recombination, and the regulation of gene expression. Recently developed methods to measure chromosome architecture have shown that the genome folds into structures of increasing sizes during interphase: loops, domains, compartments, and territories1,2. However, previous studies have mainly used genome-wide biochemical methods on cultured cell populations to indirectly infer structure and inform computational models of how chromosomes fold in the nucleus. As a result, many gaps remain in our knowledge regarding the role of chromosome structure in vivo. Specifically, how does chromosome organization change in the cells and tissues of an animal? Second, do chromosome structure changes reflect cellular replication, growth and division, or are they a feature of cell fate specification - or a combination of both? The first question will be addressed in Aim 1, and the second in Aim 2. To address these aims, I will exploit the stereotyped cell lineage of C. elegans, where each cell has been identified, and I will track chromosome conformation for specific cell types and their progenitors during embryonic development. I will directly map chromosome structure using a novel high-throughput imaging approach that preserves the cellular, tissue, and organismal contexts of chromosomes.In Aim 1, I will compare the interphase chromosome architecture of different cell lineages in the embryo to define cell-type specific architectures. The germline lineage is the most likely to have a unique architecture, and I will focus on comparing germline and somatic cells to address the relationship between structure and cell identity. I will determine if specific conformations precede, coincide, or follow functional transcriptional output and lineage restriction, which will help to elucidate the causal relationships between these events. In Aim 2, I will map chromosome architecture through the stages of the cell cycle to model the structural transitions that occur as embryonic cells grow and divide. This aim will identify inherited conformational signatures and identify the conformational rearrangements that occur as embryonic cells replicate, divide, and re-establish interphase architecture. I will collaborate with polymer physicists to incorporate structural measurements into computational models of chromosome transitions in the cell cycle. The results of my work will be a conformational atlas of chromosomes in embryogenesis, with a focus on cell type and cell cycle dynamics. I will determine how the specific history of a cell informs its current and future molecular state.

While MR imaging is a good candidate to provide such biomarkers, an accurate segmentation of the single muscle groups is an important step for the correct image analysis and evaluation.The segmentation of medical images is a task that has been optimally tackled by deep learning methods in the recent years. However, the accuracy of a deep learning model heavily depends on the type, the quantity and the quality of the data used for the training, and the relative rarity of these diseases often prevents a single site or clinic from having sufficient data for the task, and often from even having the appropriate software tools for an accurate and effective segmentation.In this project, I propose to develop a collaborative segmentation platform that would be accessible to users around the globe, who can use it as a tool to segment their own images, and by doing so, they would contribute to the improvement of the accuracy of the platform itself.

"Goetschel, Laurent",NA,Departement Gesellschaftswissenschaften / Politikwissenschaft (Goetschel); swisspeace foundation / Peace Research (Goetschel),"International Peacemaking in Pursuit of a ""Good Peace"": Integration or Separation?",2020,"The challenge of peacemaking has predominantly been understood as a pragmatic exercise in problem solving - how to devise the most effective peace deal that will be adopted by the conflict parties and end the violence. However, international peacemakers and conflict parties do not only ask ""what works?"" in trying to end conflicts; they are also driven by the question ""what is the right thing to do?"". This research project asks how this normative dimension shapes international peacemaking, thereby addressing a thus far undertheorised facet. To do so, it focuses on a particular aspect of peacemaking: approaches to managing diversity after conflict. What do international peacemakers and conflict parties believe to be a ""good peace"", and how does this shape their views on diversity management? From a purely pragmatic viewpoint, diversity can be managed in a range of ways, which entail either the integration or separation of groups, including through partitions and the re-drawing of borders, the resettlement of populations, or the recognition or denial of minority rights. And yet, while some of these may reduce violence, not all are considered equally acceptable or desirable. This indicates that there is a normative dimension to international peacemaking, whereby peacemakers' visions of a ""good peace"" contribute to shaping their actions. Despite the important influence of this normative dimension in delineating the options available to peacemakers, mediation scholars have overlooked how it operates. The project draws on constructivist assumptions of interests and identities as socially constructed, and of political actors choosing strategies as much out of a sense of wanting to do the right thing, as wanting to do what works best. In other words, we assume that actors make decisions based on both normative imperatives and utility-maximising, and we employ tools from norms research to study the contestation over norms of diversity management in peace processes. The project connects three bodies of literature filling gaps in each: the literatures on peacemaking, on norms in international relations (IR), and on diversity management following ethnic and other inter-group conflicts. It contributes to these by foregrounding normative dimensions that are undertheorised in peacemaking scholarship. To do so, the project studies the discourses and practices of international peacemakers in relation to their vision of appropriate diversity management and how those interact with the conflict parties' respective visions. Further, it conceptually extends the existing scholarship on diversity management in peace and conflict studies by mapping approaches across policy levels including demographic, territorial, institutions, and legal spheres. The project contributes to theory building and sheds light on an understudied phenomenon, making inductive use of case study methods through a combination of conceptual work, intra-case analysis with process tracing, and cross-case comparisons. Empirically, the project explores visions of a ""good peace"" in relation to diversity by studying how questions of population displacement and resettlement, political boundary-making, and institutional and legal recognition of diversity have been addressed in six different contexts of international peacemaking over the last decades. Within each of these contexts, a number of discrete peacemaking episodes, spanning several decades and including a range of different peacemakers, are explored in depth through process tracing. The final research step consists of exploratory comparisons that aim at theory building about peacemaking's underexplored normative dimension.",NA,external_funding,Active,4604620,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,672,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

Chances of invasion begins to increase once resources within a population begins to increase (Davis 2003), therefore creating instability for native populations. Competition for resources, such as habitat, could potentially lead to the exclusion of a species following ""the competitive exclusion principle"" by Hardin (1960). This principle means that when shared resources are met by coexisting species, competition will occur. Species which share similar morphology and are normally isolated from one another, tend to share the same resource requirements. An issue can occur when two such similar species occur in the same area, which normally do not coexist. This has occurred between two semi-aquatic Natricine snake species: viperine snake, Natrix maura (Lennaeus, 1758), and the dice snake, Natrix tessellata (Laurenti, 1768). N. maura and N. tessellata populations used in this study are located between the cities of Lausanne and Villeneuve, in the canton of Vaud, Switzerland. These two populations reside on the shore of Lake Geneva (also known as Lake Leman).  The area has been developed and consists of villages, vineyards, roads, and railways. For instance, much of the shoreline has railroads constructed along side of it. The riparian region of Lake Geneva consists of a rocky, partially vegetated slope terrain (Metzger et. al.  2009). N. maura is a native species to the shores of Lake Geneva, while N. tessellata (Morton 1925) has been introduced. Both species are found along this shoreline and it has also been documented that N. tessellata has partially colonize some habitat areas that are unfavorable to N. maura (Metzger et. al. 2009). Ursenbacher et. al. (Submitted) previously documented N. maura to have an average decline of 4.4% each year. The exact reason for this decline is unknown, but it is thought to be correlated with the introduction of N. tessellata because of its similarities in ecological niches, such as habitat preference and diet it shares with N. maura (Metzger et. al.  2009). Due to N. maura's decline, it has been listed as ""critically endangered"" in Switzerland (Monney and Meyer 2005). The natural distribution of N. tessellata does not include Lake Geneva and it is believed to have been released to Lake Geneva between 1925 and 1935 (Gautschi et al. 2002).

There, from 1612 to 1770, seven Barons of Haldenstein produced coins of varying quality, representative gold and larger silver denominations along with small ones below standard. Several thousand items of broken crucibles, melting waste, test strikings of coin dies, blanks, clippings of strips, and coins document the complete production cycle from the melting of the silver alloy to the cutting of blanks and coins. The quality in the production and of the coins was almost always poor. Thus many technical details are visible in the mint waste and in the coinage that could not be detected on well produced coins. All these elements allow a unique insight in the transition of an early modern mint to a machinery based production center. The mint was installed in several rooms, all oriented towards the central court of the castle. Only few structures are documented.

Southern Authoritarianism, Tourism and the &#34;Free West&#34;, 1945-1975",2012,"International historical scholarship on democracies and dictatorships in Europe has focused primarily on two topics: the emergence of dictatorships in the interwar period, and the East-West conflict after 1945. Less attention has been paid to the complex relationship between democracies and dictatorships within Western Europe: after 1945, the democratic governments in Europe regarded the authoritarian regimes in Spain and Portugal as relics of the fascism they had just defeated in war. Nevertheless, during the Cold War, they included them in the Western sphere in order to strengthen political or ideological opposition against the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc. The existing historical research has analyzed this relationship so far mostly in terms of political and diplomatic contacts or anticommunist networks. In contrast, this project focuses on an aspect of this relationship which was essential for the Iberian economies and societies of the postwar decades: the flow of tourists from Western Europe to Spain and Portugal. As a transnational cultural history of tourism, it analyzes the relationship between democracies and dictatorships as reflected in tourism policies that facilitated travels to the Iberian Peninsula. The aspects addressed include, for example, contacts and interactions between tourism experts in politics, economy, and marketing; discussions and decisions in international organizations; depictions of the dictatorships in travel literature; and attempts to limit tourism to the dictatorships as a form of protest against these regimes. The study argues that tourism policies created a sphere of contact, collaboration, and mutual dependency; while this sphere was often portrayed as ""neutral"" or ""independent"" from politics, tourism had a significant impact on the relationships between democracies and dictatorships in general.

"Bickel, Susanne",NA,Departement Altertumswissenschaften / Ägyptologie (Bickel),Dissertation Julianna Kitti Paksi: Linguistic Heterogeneity in the Ramesside Royal Inscriptions,2012,"The project concerns the study of linguistic heterogeneity in the language of the Ramesside royal inscriptions (ca. 1300-1100 BC). The focus is on ten texts selected from a chronologically and thematically wide corpus of monumental hieroglyphic inscriptions. Each of these texts is subject to a detailed, descriptive and interpretative linguistic analysis, during which factors influencing their diverse linguistic selections are explored. The aim of the project is to arrive at a differentiated, yet systematic, description of the language of the inscriptions and to identify the aspects of cultural dynamics underlying these linguistic selections.  The history of the Egyptian language is at the same time a complex history of its written registers. By the early Nineteenth Dynasty (ca. 1275 BC), new linguistic norms (roughly: ""Late Egyptian"") started to spread and became the written language in certain domains of use, while older norms (roughly: ""Middle Egyptian"") continued to be used in other domains. However, the two linguistic norms were by no means discrete, let alone exclusive of one another. The diglossic situation thus observed involved a dynamic continuum of written linguistic registers between more innovative and more conservative ones. The interaction of the two linguistic norms is present in all genres and is therefore integral to the written production in Ramesside times. The phenomenon of linguistic heterogeneity resulted in profoundly diverse linguistic typologies that are often observed also within one and the same text. This linguistic heterogeneity is seen to take particularly rich and productive forms in the Ramesside royal inscriptions, to the study of which the present project is devoted.  This study will be the first systematic description of the language of the Ramesside royal inscriptions, and as such, will fill a gap in the history of the Egyptian language understood as a history of its written registers. In the current context of studies devoted to linguistic variation in other, comparatively lower written registers of the Ramesside period, the project investigates the higher written registers of the same time, which have received only modest scholarly attention so far.","royal inscriptions, linguistic heterogeneity, Ramesside period, linguistic registers, monumental inscriptions, égyptien de tradition",own_funding,Completed,1517244,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,698,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Objective: This dissertation focuses on the geography in society and addresses issues of and reasons for living in the right or wrong place in a globalizing city. Specifically, the following questions are addressed: How does the social housing policy system (multi-level structure and allocation policies) affect the spatial structure of ""poverty landscapes"" in the globalizing City of Guangzhou? What interrelationships exist between the policy system and spatial social structure? In what way may housing policy contribute to spatial inequalities? While much research is being devoted to understanding how a city like Guangzhou can become a global city, this dissertation seeks to understand the emergence of poverty landscapes in a globalizing city, using a unique combination of statistical analysis of spatial social structures and innovations in visualization. Visualization of spatial social structure and analyzing spatial social structure data in the context of social housing policy will contribute to understanding how poverty landscapes emerge amidst economic growth and how one could change the emerging globalizing urban landscape of Chinese cities from one of chance and division to one of equality and opportunity.

For more than two decades, rates of obesity in liver transplant candidates have been rising; and weight gain after transplantation is contributing to a further increase of obesity in the post-transplant course. Weight gain and subsequent obesity is the result of an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure. The mechanisms behind weight gain, however, are far more complex and depend on a multitude of interrelated factors such as genetic, sociodemographic, behavioral, biomedical, psychological, and environmental factors. Despite the multifaceted dynamics, energy balance related behaviors, such as physical activity and healthy diet, are among the most influential factors and can be targeted via behavioral interventions. In general, obesity is associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality as well as metabolic and cardiovascular comorbidities. Due to the immunosuppressive drugs, liver transplant recipients are already at a higher risk for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases compared to the general population. Maintenance of a healthy lifestyle and the promotion of energy balance related behaviors, i.e., healthy diet and physical activity is therefore highly relevant after transplantation. However, in the transplant population, there is a lack of evidence on: factors related to weight gain and obesity after transplantation; the impact of post-transplant weight gain and obesity on patient outcomes; and behavioral interventions to support effective weight management. The BALANCE project was designed as a multiphase mixed method research project including two systematic literature reviews with meta-analyses, three quantitative data analyses of the prospective nationwide STCS, and a study with qualitative interviews to explore the patients' perspectives. The results will inform the development of a weight management intervention based on behavior change, diet and physical activity. The systematic development of the intervention will be guided by the behavior change wheel. We expect that this scientific rigorous approach will provide essential knowledge to the so far limited body of evidence concerning energy balance related behavior and weight management after transplantation.

The PICASSO-TX Project,2013,"Despite a survival gain in the first year after transplantation (Tx), long-term survival did not improve much over time. Nonadherence to a healthy lifestyle or medication is common post-Tx and increases the risk for morbidity and mortality. Regrettably, few studies tested the effect of interventions aiming to support post-Tx patients' self-management. Using interactive health technology (IHT) might facilitate behavioral change, but its success will likely depend on the patient's preference or comfort with using computerized applications, as well as its costs. The following aims are driving our proposed program of research:1. To develop a core SM intervention with an interactive health technology (IHT) option to support medication taking, level of physical activity and weight control in adult kidney, liver, heart and lung Tx recipients2. To test the feasibility and usability of the core SM intervention with and without IHT option and to determine the effect size of the intervention. To evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a preference based SM intervention with IHT option after solid organ Tx on medication adherence, physical activity levels, and weight control (primary outcomes). This is a RTC. Besides a usual care group (group 1), some patients will be offered the choice between the core (group 2) and the IHT enhanced self-management intervention (group 3), while others will be randomly assigned to either the core (group 4) or the IHT enhanced intervention (group 5).

The specific spatial structures of proteins are determining their function. Computer simulations aim at reliably modeling the properties of three-dimensional protein structures that have not previously been elucidated experimentally. By providing information about their function at an atomic level of detail, modeling is applied in basic research on protein function as well as in drug development. Assessing the Reliability of Protein Structure Models As it is crucial to regularly assess the reliability of protein structure predictions, the ""Continuous Automated Model EvaluatiOn (CAMEO)"" platform conducts fully automated blind prediction assessments based on the weekly pre-release of sequences of those structures, which are going to be published in the next release of the PDB Protein Data Bank. CAMEO publishes weekly benchmarking results based on models collected during a 4-day prediction window, on average assessing ca. 100 targets during a time frame of 5 weeks. CAMEO benchmarking data is generated consistently for all participating methods at the same point in time, enabling developers to benchmark and cross-validate their method's performance, and directly refer to the benchmarking results in publications. In order to facilitate server development and promote shorter release cycles, CAMEO sends weekly email with submission statistics and low performance warnings. CAMEO offers a variety of scores to allow benchmarking diverse aspects of structure prediction methods, including introducing new scoring schemes. In summary, CAMEO facilitates new development in structure prediction in areas of active research, for example, modeling quaternary structure, complexes, or ligand binding sites.

Transplantoux (= Transplantation + Mont Ventoux) was therefore launched by the University Hospitals of Leuven as a two yearly event with the goal to train solid organ transplant recipients in a 6-month intensive exercise program with the ultimate goal to cycle or hike up the Mont Ventoux (distance: 25.9 km, slope: 4.4%). Extending on a previous safety feasibility study in which we demonstrated that selected Tx-recipients can safely participate in an intense exercise program and that physical fitness was significantly improved after training. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the effect of the 'Transplantoux' intervention in view of selected Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO).

"Schuldt, Heiko",NA,Departement Mathematik und Informatik / Datenbanken (Schuldt),SportSense,2014,"Game analysis is an important task in sports, especially in team sports. The objective is to analyze the behavior (strengths, weaknesses) of other teams. Currently, this is mainly a manual task, done by coaches or dedicated game analysts based on videos of the teams to be analyzed. The goal of the SportSense project is twofold. First, we apply novel algorithms to detect semantic events within continuous streams of data. Wearable sensors are more and more becoming widely available in team sports. However, these sensors only produce basic information (such as the position and speed of a player). A big challenge is to derive higher semantic events out of these streams of data. This can be statistics on ball possession, but also a more sophisticated analysis of the tactical behavior of the entire team. Second, we apply novel sketch- and content-based approaches to video retrieval to support the tasks of coaches and game analysts. The objective is to facilitate the search for scenes in sport videos. In most cases, queries are formulated on the basis of specific motion characteristics the coach is interested in or remembers from previous views of the video. Providing sketching interfaces for graphically specifying query input is thus a very natural user interaction for a retrieval application. However, the quality of the query (the sketch) heavily depends on the memory of the user and her ability to accurately formulate the intended search query by transforming this 3D memory of the known item(s) into 2D sketch query. Therefore, appropriate user interfaces have to be provided that are easy to use and that allow for the specification of rough sketches.

Beaver Fur and the Creation of Markets in the 17th Century,2014,"How did value emerge before the rise of capitalism? What was the impact of materiality on the creation of value? And how did longing change the demand and supply of commodities? Based on the methodological triangle of practices, materials and affects my project explores the relation between the longing for beaver fur and the creation of early modern markets from a global perspective. The various textures of beaver fur are suitable for the study of material desires and for the examination of practices, since every processing step created novel longings and shaped new markets. In the 17th century, beaver fur was world-wide in high demand: as spoil in North America and Russia, as transatlantic commodity, as resource for luxury goods and as hunting apparel, as status symbol for merchants and as currency of trading companies. My case studies of the Dutch colony New Netherland (1609-1664) support the argument that supply and demand were not the only influential factors to early modern markets. Furrier knowledge and the effort to regulate markets and to stabilize social order were important to the creation of markets as well. The fashionable beaver hats embodied the promises of material wealth, the founding of colonies and the launch of trading companies. Dutch fur trade records allow to explore global material desires and the creation of early modern markets. Based on New Netherland records (trading correspondences, court papers, regulations, orders, engravings, maps, travel reports, portraits) and on beaver fur hats from the 17th century my project is structured into four parts: Part 1 discusses the creation of global beaver fur markets while taking into account that globally demanded hats were manufactured with different materials from different places in the world. Part 2 studies the Dutch imaginations of New Netherland as a market of promises and emphasizes the contemporary economic practice of projecting. Part 3 takes the textures of exchanges into account and unfolds the organization of colonial beaver fur markets based on intercultural social relations, in particular between Europeans and Natives. Part 4 explores the creation of local, colonial fashion and textile markets in the settlements of New Netherland against the background of mercantile economic practices and protectionist legislation. By connecting economic concepts with material culture, knowledge transfer, affects, trading practices and social dynamics, my project challenges established economic, cultural and social narratives of early modern markets.

We offer an explanation of the price spread using a structural model of the price for Certified Emissions Reductions that combines three features: A limit for the use of Kyoto offsets within the EU ETS; a disconnect between the current price of offsets and their marginal cost of production due to institutional reasons; and uncertainty about future supply and demand of offsets. Our model expresses the offset price as an average of the EU allowance price and an offset's outside value, weighted by the probability of a binding import limit. Using monthly series of the United Nation's Clean Development Mechanism and Joint Implementation about offset supply and demand, we provide empirical support for our theory of offset price formation.

In the last decade, Digital Humanities have emerged as one of the most innovative and dynamic field of research and scholarly practices in the Humanities. What used to be a sub-domain of the Humanities based on the computational analysis of text-based sources, has grown to a vast array of scholarly practices, encompassing a variety of digital-based research methods, the production of tools, and other forms of scholarly objects. All the while, Digital Humanities aim at engaging the general public as well as an epistemic reflexion about the role of digital media in knowledge production. To this day, the historical sciences have not recognized the full potential of Digital Humanities for themselves. Reactions within the scientific community vary from expressed interest for experimenting with digital methods, to declared hostility for what some consider to be an academic trend of little intellectual interest. Nonetheless, there is a shared understanding that these tensions are a consequence of the fact that digital technologies question established practices such as research methods, scholarly communication, quality evaluation of results, science-society communication and transdisciplinary collaborations.

Conventional wisdom has it that in the last two centuries the rural world has been eaten up by the urban, a process that has turned the world into one great interior. This view, so the book contends, obscures the underlying transformations of territory that define the geopolitics of urbanization. Urban growth is not only an economic and social process, but also an epistemological and political project, in which the countryside is of fundamental importance. Reinvented in nineteenth-century aesthetic discourse, the trope of the rural was instrumental to a new form of state power focused on mastering the interior. From sub-saharan Africa and South America to the heartlands of imperial Europe, this project entailed not only the rationalization of agriculture, but also the managing of migration, techniques of colonization and social engineering, and the aesthetics of nation-building.

Initiated by the seminal contribution from Galor and Weil (2000), Unified Growth Theories propose unique frameworks to explain the economic take-off and the demographic transition with the following fundamental idea: Once technological progress occurs, it incites individuals to invest in children's human capital. The quality-quantity trade-off sets in. Parents increase education and reduce fertility (Galor, 2011). Denmark and Sweden are typical examples for the dynamics of fertility and mortality during the demographic transition. Until the middle of the 19th century, fertility and mortality remained on a rather high level. Then, mortality and later on fertility decreased. Simultaneously, the economic take-off, urbanization and industrialization took place. More recently, crude birth and death rates stagnate on a low level. Although timing and intensity differ across regions, general dynamics are quite similar and explained by various alternative theories, see e.g. Doepke (2004), Galor and Weil (2000), Cervellati and Sunde (2005). While most economists studied the interplay of the economic take-off and demographic transition on the country-level, demographers like Dyson (2011) and Bocquier and Costa (2015) emphasized urban-rural fertility and mortality differentials. Natural population growth was higher in the countryside than in cities such that urbanization required population flows. The emergence of ""production cities"" relates industrialization to urbanization (Gollin et al., 2016) and suggests that mobility played a key role in the interplay of urbanization, industrialization and the fertility transition.

The computational grid and cloud are examples of such distributed (possibly heterogeneous) computing systems and offer multiple hierarchical levels of parallelism: site, cluster, node, socket, core, vector, pipeline, and instruction [1]. Each level of parallelism requires at least a scheduler. For instance, at the cluster level there are batch schedulers and runtime systems. Depending on the level of parallelism, schedulers can be viewed as global and local. From a site level parallelism perspective, global schedulers distribute the computational tasks or the communication among the different sites, whereas local schedulers distribute the tasks or the communication among the computational nodes of a particular site. Furthermore, from the cluster level parallelism perspective, decisions made by the runtime system regarding the initial placement of application tasks to locally assigned computing resources can significantly influence the outcome of a cluster level scheduler. The scheduling goals differ from level to level and may be conflicting between levels. For instance, cluster level schedulers typically aim at maximizing fairness among all applications in terms of their execution time which may result in non-optimal execution times for certain applications. Application level schedulers typically aim at minimizing the execution time of a single application, which may result in non-balanced execution times among applications. Addressing the problem jointly at multiple levels is called multi-level scheduling and constitutes a multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem.

Thus, a feature of interest for scheduling scientific applications in such environments is support for fault detection and management. This characterizes the quality aspect of the time-to-solution. A solution to the application-level resilience to faults problem must meet the following requirements: (i) Efficiency, without compromising performance; (ii) The reliability level must be user controlled - greater reliability incurs a higher cost (either in terms of resources, CPU time, energy consumption, or allocation price); and (iii) Minimal code changes in the application. Scheduling algorithms that detect faults and are able to manage them are called fault tolerant (or resilient to faults).

"Leuppi, Jörg D.","Zeller, Andreas",Faculty of Medicine; Departement Klinische Forschung; Bereich Medizinische Fächer (Klinik),RECUT,2015,"Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major public health issue affecting approximately five to seven percent of the Swiss population. According to current guidelines for the inpatient setting, systemic corticosteroids are most important in the treatment of acute COPD exacerbations and should be given for five to seven days. Several studies suggest that corticosteroids accelerate the recovery of the FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in one second), enhance oxygenation, decrease duration of hospitalization and improve clinical outcome. However, the additional therapeutic benefit on FEV1 recovery appears to be most distinctive in the first three to five days. No data are available on the minimal necessary corticosteroid dose and treatment duration in primary care patients with acutely exacerbated COPD. Given the fact that many patients are treated in an outpatient setting, there is an urgent need to improve evidence about COPD management in this setting. Methods: The proposed study is a prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial that is conducted in a primary care setting including an anticipated 470 patients with acutely exacerbated COPD. Participants receive systemic corticosteroid treatment equivalent of 40 mg prednisone daily for either five days (conventional arm, n = 235), or for three days, followed by two days of placebo (experimental arm, n = 235). Antibiotic treatment for seven days is given to all patients with CRP &#8805; 50 mg/l, known diagnosis of bronchiectasis, or presenting with Anthonisen Type-I exacerbation. Additional treatment after inclusion are left at the discretion of the treating general pracititioner. Follow-up visits are performed on days three and seven by the treating general practitioners, followed by telephone interviews on das 30, 90 and 180 after inclusion into the study.

So far no comprehensive study was ever conducted on this subject with data from Swiss companies and their Corporate Philanthropy activities. The overarching aim of this project is to develop a better understanding of the interdependencies of CSR and corporate philanthropy. Especially to help understand, if and how corporate philanthropy activities create a win-win-situation for both business and society. The descriptive research aim is to conduct a first conclusive overview of the different forms of corporate philanthropy and their state of action in Switzerland. Additionally, a better understanding of the linkages between corporate philanthropy, CSR and firm profitability will be developed using the collected data on corporate philanthropy in Switzerland. The explorative research aim of the project is to detect rules and criteria to value the impact of corporate philanthropy on the company's social embeddedness (as civil society actor). The findings of this research project will have a major effect on the theoretical debate on corporate philanthropy and corporate social behavior in general.

The project addresses this gap. It explores how and in what ways practices of (everyday) violence such as shooting, flogging or beating and the meanings ascribed to them were (re)shaped in the border region of southern Namibia and the northern Cape between c. 1880 and 1910. African actors, especially Nama-Oorlam and Herero groups, are at the center of its focus. In order to gain insights into the different actor's habits of using violent practices and to discern possible shifts, the project seeks to closely describe everyday violent practices and to situate them in the historical context of African pastoralism, settler colonialism and colonial state-building. Adopting an entangled history perspective and drawing on frontier and borderland concepts, the project furthermore explores whether there were instances of mutual learning and adaptation between African, Afrikaner and European actors in the course of their (violent) encounters. The study will thus contribute to a growing body of scholarly literature in Africanist and European colonial historiography discussing shared practices of colonial violence and the role of mutual observation and knowledge transfers. The empirical analysis of everyday violent practices shifts the attention away from extreme violence, combat and warfare and de-centers previous approaches solely focusing on European colonial actors. Such a perspective yields new insights into the (trans)formation of social relations in southwestern Africa around the turn of the century and into the role of violence in settler colonialism more broadly.

To efficiently mitigate and control soil losses by erosion and reduce their environmental impacts, reliable and validated methods for comprehensive data generation on the magnitude and spatial extent of soil erosion are needed. Sheet erosion, which is one of the main forms of erosion, is particularly difficult to investigate with conventional methods. The fallout radionuclide 137Cs proved to be successful to determine sheet erosion rates but the application of the method in alpine areas is constrained (a) by the general heterogeneous distribution of atmospheric 137Cs Chernobyl fallout and the general difficulties in finding undisturbed references sites in the geomorphological and anthropogenic highly active terrain (b) in providing information on short term erosion rates and (c) sediment source areas. A suitable alternative to tackle issue (a) are the two major Plutonium isotopes (i.e. 239Pu [half-life = 24110 years] and 240Pu [half-life = 6561 years]) which have been suggested and tested as soil erosion tracers in the Alps. The second issue (b) can be addressed by replacing the classical 137Cs approach, where an undisturbed reference site is compared to erosional sites, with a re-sampling approach, where previous measurements from 2007 will be compared to a 2014 sampling, thus using temporal instead of spatial reference. Finally, a promising new technique to solve issue (c) is the compound specific isotope analysis (CSIA). Compound specific stable isotope (CSSI) signatures of inherent organic biomarkers in the soil, can discriminate and apportion the source soil contribution from different land-uses in order to reinforce the effectiveness of soil conservation measures. With the proposed concepts of combining 239+240Pu based erosion rates (averaging over the last 50 - 60 years, more homogeneous fallout distribution) with the re-sampling approach (which allows short term erosion assessment integrating the last 6 years erosive events with no dependence on undisturbed reference sites) and CSIA we are confident to overcome the above discussed limitations. Furthermore, having erosion assessments for different temporal scales will indicate impacts of climate change.

"Locher, Miriam; Bieri, Aline",NA,Departement Sprach- und Literaturwissenschaften / English Linguistics (Locher),Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) in the Swiss context: The linguistic challenges and implications of teaching a subject such as biology in English and German,2016,"Over the last two decades, Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) programmes, where a content subject is taught in an additional language, have become increasingly popular, and Switzerland is no exception. Due to its plurilingual landscape and its decentralised education system, Switzerland offers a particularly diverse context for the study of CLIL, which, compared to other European countries, is not that advanced yet. Therefore this PhD project investigates, in an extensive case study, the linguistic requirements for students and teachers in CLIL (English) and non-CLIL (German) biology lessons at a Swiss upper-secondary school (Gymnasium). In a self-collected corpus consisting of 31 video-recorded CLIL and non-CLIL biology lessons, two particularly relevant aspects are analysed: the use of multilingual and -modal resources (translanguaging) and the role of technical terms (technicality) in the classroom. Since biology lessons in Switzerland offer a highly multilingual environment - students' and teachers' first languages (Swiss German and other L1s), the languages of instruction (German or English), as well as the source languages of technical terms (Greek and Latin) - this PhD project examines the use and purpose of translanguaging practices in CLIL and non-CLIL biology lessons. Since science subjects such as biology are very often marked by a high density of technical terms, it further investigates the complicated relationship between English and German technical vocabulary as used in biology. Finally, the project explores the connection between translanguaging and technicality, and investigates how multilingual and -modal resources are used to negotiate technical terms.  The main objective of this dissertation is therefore to gain a better understanding of the role(s) of language(s) in CLIL (English) compared to non-CLIL (German) biology classes. With my PhD project I am thus not only making a much-needed contribution to Swiss CLIL, but I also contribute to current CLIL research regarding translanguaging and science education due to the project's specific focus on translanguaging practices and the negotiation of technical terms in the CLIL and non-CLIL biology classroom.","CLIL, biology, technicality, translanguaging, Switzerland",own_funding,Completed,3572984,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,784,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Marketization describes the process of nonprofit organizations becoming more business-like and is caused, among other things, by increased competition for scarce resources, the rise of professionalism, and calls for more transparency and efficiency by funders and the public. Research about marketization is inconclusive; some researchers believe marketization can increase not only efficiency, but also effectiveness of organizations, while others fear that nonprofits lose their focus on a social mission. The four articles presented in this thesis focus on the theoretical and practical implications of nonprofits relying more on earned income, a dominant feature of marketization, and nonprofits actively and passively adopting management practices and tools from the for-profit sector, another key characteristic of increased marketization. The results show that marketization can increase the economic and social performance of an organization, and, when handled well and implemented through a clear strategic focus, foster mission achievement. Particularly the focus on beneficiaries and internal processes can help organizations to better fulfill their mission. A loss of focus on the mission must be feared if regulatory forces act on the organization without a simultaneous professionalization of management, or if an organization focuses too much on its competitors.",NA,own_funding,Completed,3697248,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,786,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Due to this wide range of indications and their low toxicity compared to other drugs, BZD became one of the most commonly used and misused drug class worldwide. BZD are potentially addictive. A very common form of BZD dependence is iatrogenic i.e. patients have been prescribed BZD to treat underlying conditions and then progress to a long-term use (&gt;4-8 weeks) with optional dose increase. In 2014, the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health published recommendations for a restricted prescription and dispense of BZD in daily practice. The overall objective of BZD withdrawal aims at total abstinence, as discontinuation mostly improves psychomotor and neurocognitive functioning, particularly in the elderly. Outpatient withdrawal has proven feasible. Except for a slow dose reduction, recommendations are vague and the optimal rate of tapering is unclear. The success of pharmacological interventions for BZD dependence management is poor to moderate. Nevertheless, the outcome of successful BZD withdrawal is gratifying, both in terms of improved functioning and economic benefits.

Löwith), or ""history's religion"" (Geschichtsreligion, W. Hardtwig). All these labels express a similar underlying notion that it was constitutive for the modern European ""regime of historicity"" (F. Hartog) that, although seemingly secular, it was modeled after both mythical and theological understandings of the time of the world as unfolding between creation and the last judgment. As a prime indicator of this dependence, theorists of history have highlighted the future-orientation of modern historical consciousness. This orientation entailed a sense of history as a progressive process, toward a definitive state of equilibrium or a dynamic standard of constant improvement. As H. G. Gadamer and R. Koselleck have argued, in the 18th century, the ""space of experience"" and the ""horizon of expectation"" were separated definitively, as a result of the acceleration of technological and political change. This separation opened the opportunity to project formerly religious expectations of salvation at the end of time onto the imagination of a this-worldly historical future. This overall line of argument is a major component of notions of ""European modernity"" across various disciplines. The ability of the humanities to participate in arguments about the nature of modernity crucially hinges on this family of arguments about history's religion. We propose to challenge key components of this concept. We assume that the supposed ""secularization"" of theological temporality did not merely consist in the re-labeling of older dogmatic topoi and their grafting onto a supposedly novel understanding of historical world-time. Rather it took place in a more complex historical reality. Crucially, one has to take into account the history of the humanities as a broader and messier body of knowledge than the sterilized understanding of historical thought with which the philosophical analysis of history's religion has operated.",NA,own_funding,Active,4479340,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,789,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Since then, sequencing technologies have improved significantly, making DNA sequencing faster, easier and cheaper. Sequencing of pre-defined gene panels as well as Whole Exome Sequencing has arrived in the medical practise in many countries, Switzerland among them. Alongside other applications such as prenatal genetic diagnostics or for monogenetic rare diseases, genetic testing for cancer has been used frequently. Alongside with these genetic advances in both research and clinical practise, Ethical, Legal and Social Issues (ELSI) of genetics have been widely raised, discussed and studied. The increase in genetic medical knowledge and technologies bring many challenges that need to be addressed. This project aims to contribute to this issue by investigating factors influencing public interest and attitudes towards genetic testing with the following research questions: (1) Investigate what the most important print media from the German and the French speaking part of Switzerland have written about chosen aspects of genetic testing in the last four years; and (2) investigate attitudes, reasons and information strategies of people requesting a predictive genetic test. By conducting a media content analysis of Swiss online media we aim to assess the publicly discussed aspects about genetic testing in Switzerland. It can to some extent reflect public awareness of the different aspects on genetic testing, and might uncover possible differences between the German and French speaking part of Switzerland. In addition, this analysis is helpful for health personnel and policy makers to identify misconceptions and need for public education to foster evidence-based discussion of these topics in the (Swiss) society. Attitudes, reasons and strategies for handling decisions connected to predictive genetic testing for inherited cancer risk will be investigated by interviewing people using or interested in these genetic tests. Patient interviews can uncover attitudes and motivations for testing, as well as so far unknown factors that help patients through personal decisions and testing procedures. We decided to focus on patients here, however in a next step the interest, knowledge and attitudes of other players such as general practitioners, specialized medical doctors or health insurances will also be of interest in that context.

Such contacts activate sociolinguistic accommodation processes, which shape the language use of the immigrants and their linguistic attitudes towards the involved languages and dialects. The sociolinguistic integration of the immigrants is considered a fundamental part of their integration in the receiving society. In Spain, Madrid is one of the areas with the highest immigration rate in the last decades. Spanish-speaking immigrants as well as immigrants with different linguistic backgrounds enter in contact with the Madrilenian society and their languages and dialects play an important role in the overall integration process. Most of the Spanish-speaking immigrants, who have to adapt to a society in which dominates another variety of Spanish, come from Latin American countries (e.g. Ecuador, Colombia, Dominican Republic, etc.). Another Spanish-speaking group, which so far has not yet been considered in studies about the immigrant population in the Autonomous Community of Madrid, are the immigrants from Equatorial Guinea. Despite the fact that Equatorial Guinea is the only Spanish-speaking country in the Sub-Saharan Africa - and constitutes, therefore, a singular case in the Spanish-speaking world -, it has very little visibility in studies about the Spanish language.

The familiy member OATP2B1 exhibits a broad tissue distrubtion with abundance in various organs of known importance in drug absorption and elimination. Thus, OATP2B1 is considered a determinant of pharmacokinetics of its substrates. In the process of drug development new molecular entities are screened for interactions with relevant drug transporters using overexpressing cellular systems. The findings of those in vitro studies mainly conducted with human transporters are supplemented by in vivo animal studies conducted to provide information on pharmacokinetics and metabolic stability. However, due to interspecies divergence in transporter expression and function extrapolation of those findings to humans in preparation of the clinical assessment is challenging. In the herein proposed study I will focus on the expression and functional comparison of rat and human Oatp2b1 (OATP2B1). At first, a detailed analysis on expression levels and locaclisation in various tissues will be conducted, thereby adding information to preliminary data showing a similar expression pattern of both transporters in various tissues. During the project a cell line overexpressing the transporter will be established in order to screen known substrates of OATP2B1 for interaction with the rat transporter. In addition to these in vitro experiments pharmacokinetic studies in rats will be performed to determine the contribution of Oatp2b1 to pharmacokinetics of identified substrates and inhibitors. The second part of the study will investigate structure function relation of OATP2B1. Indeed, even if preliminary data suggested a similar tissue distribution we observed pronounced differences in uptake of the known OATP2B1 substrate estrone 3-sulfate. This observation in addition to in silico data showing differences in the amino acid sequence encompassing transmembrane domain (TMD) 9, the extracellular loop (ECL) 5, and TMD10 suggests that gradual humanization of rat Oatp2b1 in this area following functional characterization may provide insights in the structure function relation of human OATP2B1. Taken together, this study will contribute to a profound understanding of rat Oatp2b1 (in comparsion to the human transporter) thereby providing information necessary for extrapolation of data obtained during the clinical assessment in drug development.","transporter, drug absorption, pharmacokinetics, rat, species differences",own_funding,Active,3888021,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,796,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Pioneering insurance internationally (Pearson 2012: 67), British composite offices appointed their first agents in Turkey in the early 1860s. Their French rivals arrived later but made, under the aegis of the Union of Paris, all the more significant inroads into this bridgehead market. At the onset of World War I, both countries accounted for more than half of all the life insurers operating in the heartland of the Ottoman Empire. Their influence greatly diminished after the Great War and by the mid-1940s most of the British and French insurance companies had ceased their underwriting activities in the nascent Republic.    With international insurance history still emerging as an independent field of research, it should hardly surprise that the activities of Western insurers in the Turkish market remain by and large unexplored. Both British and French writings are overwhelmingly conceived as general corporate histories and, as such, continue to be framed within a national perspective. Such a rendering has its justifications, but leaves little room for a more nuanced discussion of the complexities of venturing overseas. Not only are in-house accounts bound to remain largely silent on the idiosyncrasies of these markets (Pearson 2004 : 9), they also tend to gloss over the demand side. Within economic and business histories of the late Ottoman Empire and the nascent Republic, life insurance in general and the operations of foreign life insurers in particular have so far received a degree of attention at best congruent with their limited meso-economic importance, both past and present. When not relegated to the margins of more general economic histories (Geyikda&#287;&#305; 2011), life underwriting has been subject of a limited number of general studies, scholarly articles, and company histories (see, amongst others: Bask&#305;c&#305; 2002; Koraltürk &amp; Kahya 2009; Kahya 2010; Toprak 2010; Akbulut 2014; Eldem 2015; Özger 2017).   Hier können Sie weiterlesen: https://bgsh.geschichte.unibas.ch/projekte/projekt-detail/?tx_bgshprojectsext_projects%5Bproject%5D=144&amp;tx_bgshprojectsext_projects%5Baction%5D=show&amp;tx_bgshprojectsext_projects%5Bcontroller%5D=Project&amp;cHash=165eeac0a59396591e44427a30381b56",NA,own_funding,Completed,4530746,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,801,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Given the large-scale anthropogenic alteration of natural habitats, ecological restoration is emerging as one of the most important disciplines in environmental science. In recent years, increasing efforts have been directed to the restoration of natural communities affected by human activities. We aim to assess the success of different restoration actions. For example, we evaluate the success of restored vineyards on terraced slopes in Southern Switzerland by examining various aspects of plant diversity. These vineyards have been abandoned for decades and were overgrown by forest. Success in restoring species diversity and ecosystem function is often reduced because of the lack of dispersal-limited species in the restored site. Numerous rare species are dispersal-limited, having low probabilities to re-colonize restored sites and to establish viable populations on their own, and restoration projects need to be adjusted accordingly. One possible approach is to reintroduce populations, but the long-term success of such reintroductions is rarely assessed.

A majority of the research related to stereotype threat has been focused on the detrimental effects of racial and gender stereotypes on performance in cognitive tasks (Nguyen &amp; Ryan, 2008). Even relatively subtle situational cues, such as being the token member of a group, have been shown to successfully elicit stereotype threat (Inzlicht &amp; Ben-Zeev, 2000). More recently, negative effects of age-related stereotypes on cognitive tasks, often those associated with memory, have also been investigated (Lamont, Swift, &amp; Abrams, 2015; Meisner, 2012). As beliefs, which are not necessarily based on facts, stereotypes are acquired from the social environment at an early age and therefore vary depending on culture (Levy, 2003). In addition, stereotype threat is often characterized as a conflict rooted in perceived group membership (Shapiro &amp; Neuberg, 2007). Taking this into account, stereotype threat seems like an inherently social phenomenon, yet social outcomes have been widely neglected in research. In order to remedy this oversight, Nikitin and Martiny (2016) conducted a series of studies investigating how social motivation in women is affected by activated stereotypes. When the stereotype that women perform worse than men in math was made salient, women experienced less social approach motivation after completing a math test. This effect was partially mediated by the sense of belonging to the group of students. In the present project, we investigate the effects of age-related stereotypes on the social motivation of older adults, who are approaching retirement. The aim of the studies is to uncover the mechanisms by which those stereotypes affect social experiences in a workplace context. Further research may focus on finding interventions to counteract the effects of negative age-related stereotypes. Possible interventions may use positive stereotypes, manipulate perceived group membership, or employ techniques such as self-affirmation.","adult social development, social motivation, sterotype threat, negative age stereotypes",own_funding,Completed,3695562,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,812,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

The often rare and transient nature of the multi-drug tolerant phenotype represents a particular challenge for the experimental and clinical exploration of persisting bacteria calling for a concerted and multi-pronged research approach to uncover their specific properties, clinical significance, and possible eradication strategies. While drug persistence mechanisms have been pioneered primarily in E. coli, it remains unclear how universal these features are.

HDL particles are commonly associated with reverse cholesterol transport and the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. However, HDL's shuttling goes well beyond cholesterol and lipid transport, as hormones, steroids, vitamins, miRNA and a multitude of proteins are found to be associated with and rely on HDL particle transportation. This renders these particles fundamentally important, even beyond disease management, and in demand for an atomistic description as well as an in-depth understanding of HDL maturation and biogenesis. However, due to a variable and fluid lipid interior, atomic- resolution mechanistic and structural insights are absent. This research project will elucidate atomic resolution structures of HDL particles in complex with its interaction partners at different maturation stages by combining high-resolution biophysical and computational methods in a multidisciplinary manner. A combination of solution NMR, cryo-EM and EPR spectroscopy is optimally suited to provide unprecedented insights into the maturation from early-stage discoidal HDL particles to late-stage spherical HDL particles.

The pension is a large cash transfer equal to roughly twice the median income of the working population and is received mainly by low-income individuals from population groups discriminated against during Apartheid. This paper combines analyses on the labour supply and resource allocation response upon pension receipt, where the wage rate of individuals is the crucial ingredient. I first estimate the labour supply response of pension recipients and their fellow household members by way of a fuzzy regression discontinuity design, analysing potential channels for the effects. Preliminary results suggest that those pensioners in formal employment increase their labour supply upon pension receipt, while other household members' labour supply remains unaffected. This implies that the substitution effect dominates the income effect for pension recipients. In a second step, I estimate the relative bargaining power within a household by calculating bounds on the so-called sharing rule following Cherchye et al (2015). I extend the theory on sharing rule bounds to allow for finite m household decision makers to better reflect the reality of multi-generational households in a developing nation, such as South Africa. I empirically estimate the effect of the pension on the sharing rule by way of a fuzzy regression discontinuity design for households with up to three adult household members.

Numerous bacterial pathogens targeting eukaryotic host cells have adopted these supramolecular protein assemblies for the intracellular delivery of bacterial effector proteins from the bacterial cytoplasm directly into the host cell cytoplasm. We are using zoonotic pathogens belonging to the closely related genus Bartonella (causing bartonellosis) and Brucella (causing brucellosis) to address fundamental questions related to the roles of T4S systems and their effector proteins in the establishment of chronic bacterial infection. Over the past 16 years we have established Bartonella as a powerful model for studying the cellular, molecular and evolutionary basis of T4S in bacterial pathogenesis. In early studies we have shown that the VirB T4S system represents an essential virulence device that translocates a cocktail of Bartonella effector proteins (Beps) into mammalian host cells, which subverts multiple cellular functions that facilitate chronic infection. We have then functionally characterized the bipartite secretion signal of Beps composed of a C-terminal BID domain and a charged tail. In recent years, we have assigned physiological functions to several Beps, identified some of their host cellular targets and performed corresponding structure-function analysis. We have also shown that all Beps are derived from a single ancestral effector that resulted from the fusion of a FIC domain derived from a bacterial toxin-antitoxin system that mediates AMPylation of target proteins and a BID domain derived from the secreted substrate (relaxase) of a conjugation system. We have further shown that independent Bep arsenals evolved in parallel in three Bartonella sublineages by gene duplication and diversification events, eventually resulting in Bep arsenals that facilitated adaptation of the host-restricted bartonellae to novel mammalian hosts. In the frame of the proposed project (subproject A), we want to deepen our understanding of the molecular functions of representatives of the growing repertoire of Beps by identifying their host targets and performing molecular and structure-function analysis. A major goal will be to understand the functional versatility of the limited set of Bep effector domains - FIC, BID and phosphorylated tyrosine arrays - to subvert a wide spectrum of host functions. Moreover, we want to characterize the physiological functions of representative Beps during infection using cell culture and animal infection models, with a focus of understanding how they facilitate evasion of innate immune responses by the pathogen and support bacterial spreading from the dermal infection site towards the replicative niches in deep tissues and blood.","VirB T4S system, bacterial conjugation systems,",own_funding,Active,3891199,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,839,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

At this time, depositors gather accounting and non-accounting information signal and decide whether to withdraw or stay. The situation becomes diffiult for the bank if withdrawals must be financed by costly liquidation of its assets in an illiquid market. We consider the interaction between the bank's choice of deposit contracts and the information system. In line with the earlier literature, we first show that aggressive information systems that do not trigger false alarms induces efficient deposit contracting. However, very often such information systems are not available, or even illigal. For this case, the bank must adjust its deposit contracts. We show that the bank will voluntarily offer rents to depositors. These rents reduce depositors' incentives to run after unfavorable accounting signals which is socially beneficial. If the information system is sufficiently conservative, the benefit from reduced illiquidity costs from running may outweigh the cost of the rent. Hence, the bank prefers to offer rents and induce a less detrimental equilibrium.","Bank accounting, accounting, information, credit rollover",own_funding,Active,4523661,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,854,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Following the unprecedented inflow of migrants, the EU has matched the external dimension - border protection and cooperation with third countries - with a growing concern for the internal dimension, referring in particular to legislative reforms and the appropriate balance between solidarity and responsibility. Rather than a single entity, the EU has become increasingly divided over the implementation of the comprehensive approach. While acknowledging the need to cooperate on the European level, Member States are also driven by domestic interests in view of the increasing politicisation of immigration. Certain Member States focus on border protection, others insist on fair burden-sharing. Hence, various legal and political contexts (spheres of governance) have emerged that need to be reconciled with one another.   The research analyses how Member States move between the various spheres of governance. More specifically, it maps the instruments of the comprehensive approach and analyses their interaction. The question arises whether the increasing use of informal, flexible arrangements challenges the role of law in EU migration management. As a next step, the thesis evaluates to what extent the informal sphere of Member States should be integrated into the EU legal order, considering possible tensions between the rule of law and the legitimacy of law- and policy-making.","EU institutional law, asylum, migration, crisis, legal instruments, governance, enforcement",own_funding,Completed,3889178,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,856,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

Today's paradigm focuses on changing poverty-causing structures such as low access to health care or education. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and now the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have set goals which tackle poverty, inequality and environmental degradation by urging governments to invest into areas which minimize malnutrition, increase access to health care and education. Regarding agricultural development, tremendous efforts were made during the Green Revolution from the 1950s to the 1980s when new farming methods and technologies were introduced to the developing world. However, today environmental degradation and remaining food insecurity have led to unequal development levels. In this context, the CORIGAP project (Closing rice yield gaps with reduced environmental footprint) aims to reduce yield gaps and optimize productivity of lowland intensive rice cultivation to improve food security for rice farmers. Farmers in six Asian countries, namely China, Indonesia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Vietnam participate in the project.

The first objective is to investigate if and how the socioeconomic structure of the farmers makes a difference in output and productivity levels. The second objective is to analyze the farmers' perceptions and expectations on adoption of BMPs regarding their socioeconomic characteristics. The farmers will be surveyed on long-term benefits, environmental footprint and sustainable impact as well as trade-offs and difficulties encountered while participating in the project.

Furthermore, a new survey questionnaire will be created in order to gather information on the farmers' perceptions on the project. Through a descriptive and statistical quantitative analysis, the farmers' socioeconomic characteristics and agricultural practices will be examined. Furthermore, a comprehensive picture will be put together by quantitatively analyzing the farmers' perceptions on BMP adoption.

One particularly disturbing issue are avoidable hospitalizations, associated with potential negative clinical and psychosocial outcomes and excess cost. For older, frail persons, hospitalizations can increase mortality, functional decline, delirium, and falls. Between 19% and 67% of hospitalizations from NHs might be preventable [1]. Possible reasons are NH staff members' limited capacity to detect and react to early changes in chronic conditions that commonly lead to hospitalization, the lack of advanced care planning with residents and family in end-of-life situations, and the limited access to primary care physicians / geriatricians and first diagnostic procedures in emergency situations [2-4]. This calls for new models of care to support NH care quality by enhancing care coordination, improving care workers' geriatric expertise (including the use of advanced practice nurses (ANP) and expert nurses), and investing in effective (clinical) leadership in NH [5, 6]. One promising solution, well-established in other countries, but still to be implemented and tested in Switzerland, are nurse-led interprofessional care NH models. These models have shown to improve resident satisfaction, to empower NH staff, as well as clinical outcomes including a reduction in avoidable hospitalizations [5, 7-9]. Moreover, they are typically led by APN or expert nurses and focus on residents' needs assessment, care coordination (also in view of transitions between settings), provide geriatric clinical leadership and support data-driven quality improvement [8]. APN training opportunities have only recently been introduced in Switzerland and their roles are still in development.

There is however little agreement and even less evidence-based data regarding the two key elements of this definition: the extent and the manner in which views are represented and integrated in mediation processes. If these are indeed essential factors for effective mediation processes, it is both theoretically and practically important to produce evidence-based research on inclusivity. Current academic debates pit proponents of inclusivity against skeptics. Proponents of inclusivity argue that inclusion increases public support for the peace process, provides local expertise and knowledge, broadens the discussion beyond the narrow interests of the negotiating parties, and increases the sustainability of peace agreements. Skeptics counter that inclusivity lowers the chances of reaching an agreement. They contend that agreement is easier reached amongst a limited number of actors; that exclusionary talks are sometimes necessary to achieve breakthroughs, and that selection problems prevent the real inclusion of societal views at the table. We argue that the current debate creates a false dichotomy between inclusion and exclusion. To overcome this, we focus on context and process, two dimensions that the current literature eludes. First, whereas proponents of inclusivity argue in favor of inclusion irrespective of the actors, the issues at stake and the geographical levels at which the conflicts play out, we ask: What is the relation between inclusion and conflict type? Do all contexts require the inclusion of the same set of actors? Second, while academics on both sides of the debate have paid little attention to the strategic use of inclusion at different points in a mediation process, we ask: Can mediators strategically use inclusion in a process to advance their objectives? If so, how and what are the conditions under which this strategy makes mediation more effective? By studying the relationship between inclusion, context and process, the project seeks to refocus attention on inclusivity's initial purpose as spelled out in the UN Guidance: increasing the effectiveness of mediation processes. To this end, we will conduct comparative case study analysis of mediators' inclusion strategies in six cases that vary on 1) conflict type and 2) mediator identity distinguishing between international/regional organizations, state actors, and non-state third parties. The selected cases - Syria, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Colombia, Nepal, Myanmar and Kenya - include a mix of recent (sometimes still ongoing) and historical mediation processes.","Inclusion, mediation, peace processes",own_funding,Completed,4235478,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,877,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

We address this topic from an interdisciplinary perspective, combining different methodological approaches that mutually complement and inform each other. The project has an international format, with data collection in three different countries, which allows us to study and compare processes of ageing across different societal contexts. The design of our study enables us to interconnect individual and societal factors in understanding processes of ageing. The major topics of our project center around three interrelated themes: Views on ageing, preparation for old age, and time management in old age. During the first funding period, the project has generated a data base that is unique with respect to its multi-method approach and its in-depth assessment of age-related variables and constructs in three different countries. Core findings focus on (a) the domain-specificity of views on ageing and age-related preparation, (b) processes of internalization of age stereotypes into personalized future self-views, (c) relations between ageing-related beliefs and a wide range of developmental outcomes (e.g., preparation, life events, perceived age discrimination, subjective age, well-being), (d) modes of time management and time perception (time suspension, logic of catching up, temporal self- continuity), and (e) country differences in ageing-related processes and their determinants (perceived situation of older people in a society, age stereotypes).  In a second funding period, the project will capitalize on and expand the current data base. Specifically, we will conduct additional measurement waves, resulting in a fully longitudinal, multimethod design across multiple countries. These data will allow us to separate effects of age, cohort, and historical time; to investigate the causal direction of relations between variables; and to compare and interconnect findings and insights that were gathered with different methodologies within different parts of the project. Furthermore, two countries will be added to our project. Data will be gathered in the Czech Republic in order to investigate effects of societal transformation on individual attitudes towards ageing in a country that changed from a state socialist, highly protectionist welfare regime to a capitalist society emphasizing individual liberty and responsibility. We also include data collection in the Tainan region in Taiwan in order to compare processes of ageing between more rural and metropolitan regions (Hong Kong) in Asia.

We find that the nonEHS outperforms the CH EHS for a minority of plants, but that on average, the two programs result in similar abatement efforts despite very different financial incentives.

Recent studies show an association between implicit rationing of nursing care, i.e., nursing care that is either partially or fully omitted due to a lack of resources, and negative patient and nurse outcomes. Existing studies on rationing of care used cross-sectional design correlating aspects of nurses' work environment and rationing of care. However, previous studies did not investigate the relationship between organizational factors, implicit rationing of care, and patient and nurse outcomes over time. The different time frames used to collect nurses` perceptions about rationing of care do not allow the assessment of trends and variation within- and between- units on a shift level and over time. It is crucial to gain thorough understanding of how nurses' rationing of nursing care activities prevails on a shift-level basis and over time within and between units. The purpose of the proposed RATIONAL project is (1) to establish a within-units baseline measure of rationing of care activities on medical, surgical and paediatric units by shift (day, evening, night shifts) and over 90 days; (2) to explore between-units variations of the extent and types of rationed activities across shifts and time; (3) to explore key self-perceived work environment factors (e.g. workload; staffing adequacy) in relation to rationing of care; and (4) to explore the associations of implicit rationing of care, work environment factors, with nurse (i.e. health) and patient (i.e. mortality, infections) outcomes on a shift level and over a 3 months time period.

And indeed, an increasing body of evidence suggests that the function of membrane proteins is modulated by an interplay of lipid dynamics and membrane protein dynamics. That means that the membrane composition provides a regulatory or even environment-sensing mechanism as suggested in the infrared sensing of bats and snakes. In an initial study I started a project with a college in Bordeaux, France, to investigate how lipids change their dynamics under various conditions, especially under the influence of cholesterol. We showed that cholesterol induces an ordering of the lipid acyl chains in nanodiscs. In a follow-up paper, we looked closer at the dynamic interplay between lipids and the membrane protein. We found that membrane protein dynamics are coupled to lipid dynamics in the picosecond-nanosecond, microsecond, and millisecond time scales, caused by the lipid's trans&#8722;gauche isomerization, the segmental and rotational motion of lipids, and the fluidity of the lipid phase, respectively.

It is striking how little we know from a comparative social science perspective about the attitudinal foundations of political polarization in Europe. Existing research has provided explanations for the rise of populist parties but has largely ignored the counter-reactions to the right-wing populist mobilization. Moreover, contrary to the broad popular view of increasing social fractions, the few existing single-country studies on political polarization actually find that political attitudes have de-polarized rather than become more distant. The project combines insights from three strands of research - public opinion research, the polarization literature and cleavage theory - to study attitude polarization in Europe from a comparative perspective. In total, I aim to answer three sets of questions: First, have political attitudes in Europe really polarized and with regard to what issues? Second, how do recent economic and societal changes contribute to attitude polarization in Europe? Third, does opinion polarization have an (unequal) mobilizing or de-mobilizing effect?The first part investigates how the degree of attitude polarization has changed in Europe since the early 1990s. To this aim, I suggest a refined concept of polarization that puts a main focus on polarization between different socio-economic status groups, rather than on the general population level. This is an important conceptual refinement, because polarizing trends may be hidden on the sub-population level. Second, building on the concept of attitude polarization, I develop a theoretical framework to study how economic and societal changes contribute to attitude polarization. Recent changes such as rising inequality and mass immigration to Europe have an unequal impact on the social and economic status of different socio-economic groups, which may cause attitudinal change. The core analysis of the project then investigates to what degree this unequal impact leads to polarization of political attitudes. The last part will assess the political consequences of attitudinal conflict, by studying its mobilizing and de-mobilizing effects on voters. The analyses will be based on data from social surveys (International Social Survey Programme, European Social Survey) from 24 European countries, and data from two panel studies, the British Household Panel and the German Longitudinal Election Study for a more rigorous analysis of causal effects.",Political Behavior; Political Polarization; Public Opinion; Europe,own_funding,Active,4613055,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,888,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Especially the members of the OATP1B-subfamily are known for their relevance in hepatocellular uptake, and therefore drug metabolism. Modulation of the hepatic clearance may affect the plasma concentration of drugs, and may therefore cause drug-induced adverse events. To meet this risk pharmaceutical companies are requested to test new molecular entities for interactions with drug transporters in the preclinical phase. Due to lacking orthologues of a set of human OATP-transporters in rodents there is a clear need to find new models that allow investigation of the in vivo influence of these transporters on the handling of substrate drugs. Recently it has been reported that the human OATP1B3 (hOATP1B3) transporter shows high similarity with the macaca fascicularis Oatp1b3 (mfOatp1b3) transporter. Hence, macaca fascicularis may serve as a model to assess drug-drug interactions involving OATP1B3. To test this hypothesis we aim at comparing the interaction of several substances with the human and macaca fascicularis transporters in vitro. The project is performed in collaboration with Dr. Markus Grube at the University of Greifswald. Using immunohistology and Western Blot analysis, we will confirm localization and expression of hOATP1B3 and mfOatp1b3 protein in human and macaca fascicularis liver, respectively.

In a next step, we will use the same HeLa cell model to investigate the interaction of a library of 42 structurally diverse molecules in transport inhibition studies employing 8&#8209;FcA as a model compound. The data obtained will be used to estimate the inhibitor potency (IC50) for either orthologue.

While extensive research has been conducted on the aggregate pass-through of exchange-rate changes into prices, we know very little about other means of price adjustment. For this aim, we look at the role of supply-side adjustments, that is products may enter the market, exit the market or the quality of existing products may change. We find a remarkably strong response of quality for export prices after the 2015-appreciation in Switzerland, which accounts for more than one third of the change in export prices one year after the shock. Prices for products produced in Switzerland that are sold in the domestic market adjust quality, too, but to a lesser extent. There is no systematic quality adjustment of import prices after the CHF shock.

Firms that compete with imports in the domestic market also improve quality as a response to lower prices of competitors.

The Internet has given rise to a massive transformation as to how news is being produced and consumed and focus has shifted away from traditional outlets, like newspapers or radio, to other channels, such as social media, websites, and blogs. It is partly due to this development, that information has never been so abundant and so easily accessible as it is nowadays. Nevertheless, many authors argue that there have never been so many misinformed as there are today, which has led some people to dub our time as The Age of Misinformation.

"Petrig, Anna",NA,Departement Rechtswissenschaften / Tenure Track Assistenzprofessur Völkerrecht und öffentliches Recht (Petrig),Peace and Security at Sea (PaSS),2018,"The use of force is a core issue of international law. The Peace and Security at Sea (PaSS) Project brings to the forefront the issue of use of force at sea specifically. The broad approach taken considers the use of force by individuals and States, and as part of law enforcement operations and conduct of hostilities. It is necessary to discuss the use of force at sea specifically for two reasons. First, the bulk of legal instruments and related writings pertain to the use of force at land; hence, it must be assessed from a legal and operational perspective whether and how they apply in the maritime context. Second, a series of factual and operational developments - new scenarios, new actors and new at-sea technologies - necessitate an analysis of the use of force in the context of the maritime environment. In terms of 'scenarios', situations are multiplying where it is unclear whether force is used within the framework of law enforcement operations or rather as part of conduct of hostilities (e.g. when coastguards and other civilian-manned vessels in various parts of the world's oceans carry out military rather than constabulary functions). As a consequence, it is ambiguous whether a law enforcement paradigm reigns or the more permissive law of armed conflicts is the defining approach to the use of force. In terms of 'actors', the increased use of and reliance on private actors to prevent criminal offences at sea (e.g. to protect offshore installations or to prevent piracy attacks) and even to enforce the law (e.g. fisheries laws) can be witnessed; this necessitates an assessment of their respective powers. Finally, 'at-sea technologies' remove the need for a direct encounter or physical presence in the display of force. Such technology is being used not only to respond to maritime security threats (e.g. the use of unmanned autonomous maritime systems) but also as a means of creating such threats in the first place (e.g. cyberattacks). ","law of the sea, maritime security, maritime safety, peaceful uses of the sea",own_funding,Active,4496985,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,900,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE

A set of studies address language use in interlingual and intralingual English subtitles; the way in which subtitled films and television series communicate with their viewers; the communication of subtitled data by researchers for researchers; fansubtitles and viewer comments as community products. The individual publications are as follows. (1) Subtitles and cinematic meaning-making: Interlingual subtitles as textual agents This theoretical paper adopts the point of view of the audience of subtitled films and outlines a theory of subtitles as communicative agents within the participation structures of film reception. Based on examples from three Swiss fiction films - Heidi (2015), Heimatland (2015) and Der Goalie bin ig (2014) - the following communicative effects are found and illustrated: uniformity, authorisation, foregrounding, aestheticisation, foreignisation. These effects are conceptualised in terms of Constitutive Communication theory and textual agency, which describe that by communicating with audiences, subtitles animate into being other participants in film discourse and contribute to what viewers take away in terms of characters, stories, the cultural aspects they represent and the source culture(s) from which the text is perceived to communicate. (2) Subtitled artefacts as communication - the case of Ocean's Eleven Scene 12 This article examines how Ocean's Eleven's Scene 12 and its English DVD subtitles can be analysed and understood from the perspective of the pragmatics of fiction and more generally pragmatics and communication studies. Examples from the scene are used to describe the film's participation structures. Communication with film viewers is approached from a cognitive-pragmatic perspective and in terms of Grice's Cooperative Principle. Agency in this communicative setting is discussed from the perspective of Constitutive Communication Theory. (3) Ocean's Eleven Scene 12 - Lost in Transcription  Since analysts view film scenes in different reception situations and since even the same reception situation will lead to differing textual representations of data, the basis for researchers' analyses may nonetheless be underspecified. This article identifies aspects of data selection and transcription that are all too often neglected, but are critical for analysis and should not only be reflected on more thoroughly but also explicated to readers.  (4) Translating the other: Communal TV watching of Korean TV drama (second author; first author: Miriam Locher) (5) Humour support and emotive stance in comments on K-Drama (First author, Second author: Miriam Locher)  ","Pragmatics of fiction, pragmatics, audiovisual translation, subtitling, participation structures",own_funding,Active,4515904,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,904,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

The digitalization in healthcare means that data is available to different parties without much barriers, but this also raises many ethical questions. Thus data security problems are getting much more prominent because of the ubiquity of data existence on each and every patients and that too in easily usuable ways by third parties. In the case of psychiatry, the availability of digitalized data of many patients is even more concerning in light of heavy stigmas associated with mental health problems. At the same time, persons with mental disorders need an interdisciplinary treatment and rehabilitation, and hence, the problem of data sharing, confidentiality, and respect for patients' privacy among health institutions, researchers, and insurance companies is essential. The goal of this project is to consider ethical issues on a role of EMRs and DTs in mental healthcare and to answer critical ethical questions of current interest. This project will be carried out both in Russia and Switzerland using a comparative qualitative research approach. The results of the project will provide highly important information on personalized mental health in the era of big data.

Recently, we characterized a novel member of the OATP1B transporter family, OATP1B3-1B7 (also known as LST-3TM12). We showed that SLCO1B3-1B7 is a splice variant of SLCO1B3 and the SLCO1B7 and encodes for a functional protein expressed in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) of hepatocytes and enterocytes. We further found that vaccinia virus based heterologous expression of OATP1B3-1B7 in HeLa cells resulted in an enhanced cellular accumulation of E2G and DHEAS. In a first screen using the same HeLa overexpressing system with DHEAS as a model substrate we observed inhibition of OATP1B3-1B7 for several known OATP1B substrates. One such inhibitor, ezetimibe, was also identified as a substrate of OATP1B3-1B7. Ezetimibe is extensively metabolized by hepatic and intestinal UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) which belong to an important class of Phase II drug metabolizing enzymes in the SER. Using human liver microsomes (HLM), subcellular particles derived from the SER of hepatic cells and thus inherently expressing OATP1B3-1B7, we found that both uptake and metabolism of ezetimibe is significantly inhibited by the known OATP1B3-1B7 inhibitor bromosulphtalein (BSP). Hence we hypothesized that OATP1B3&#8209;1B7 may facilitate access to metabolizing enzymes located in the SER. To extend our knowledge on OATP1B3-1B7 substrate specificity we will investigate another 24 clinically relevant compounds for their interaction with OATP1B3-1B7 using the aforementioned HeLa cell system with DHEAS as a model substrate. All compounds included in this screen are either glucuronidated directly or glucuronidated after Phase I metabolism necessitating access to UGTs in the SER for metabolism and elimination of these compounds. For drugs shown to reduce intracellular accumulation of DHEAS we will estimate the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50). Compounds presenting with a significant inhibitor potency will be further investigated applying uptake and metabolic studies in HLMs as described for ezetimibe; in brief, we will investigate the impact of the candidate drugs on DHEAS accumulation in HLMs. For the compounds significantly inhibiting DHEAS accumulation in HLMs we will then assess the extent of glucuronidation in absence or presence of OATP1B3-1B7 inhibitor BSP.

Considering their expression in intestine, liver or kidney, they are most likely involved in drug absorption, distribution and elimination. One member of this superfamily of uptake transporters is OATP2B1 that exhibits ubiquitous expression with high levels in liver, placenta, kidney, intestine, heart, and skeletal muscle. OATP2B1 has been shown to mediate the uptake of endogenous substances such as steroid sulfates including estrone 3-sulfate and xenobiotics such as antidiabetics and statins assessed by in vitro experiments. However, contrary to the OATP1B family members, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, where clinical studies demonstrated the relevance of these drug transporters in pharmacokinetics, little is known about the contribution of OATP2B1 to the handling of its substrates in vivo. However, considering that this protein is highly expressed in different tissues it is assumed to be involved in different physiological processes and pharmacokinetics. Animal models might be suitable to analyze the function of the transporter in vivo. Accordingly, we have conducted a comparative analysis of the rat (rOatp2b1) and human (hOATP2B1) transporter. We detected comparable tissue expression pattern of both proteins, but learned that there are pronounced differences in substrate recognition, especially for sulfated metabolites. Our data showed that hOATP2B1, but not rOatp2b1 transports estrone 3-sulfate and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate while other previously reported hOATP2B1 substrates like atorvastatin and bromosulfophthalein are substrates of the rat orthologue. This finding was basis for the herein proposed research project aiming to study the function of hOATP2B1 in physiology and pharmacology using an animal model that expresses the human protein. In detail, the role of hOATP2B1 will be determined applying rOatp2b1 knock-out and hOATP2B1 knock-in rats.

In Switzerland, it causes several between 1000 and 5000 hospitalizations and about 400-1500 deaths annually both from the virus itself and from complications such as secondary bacterial infections (BAG 2017a). Vaccination is the most effective strategy to reduce virus transmission and decreases the severity of influenza, number of complications and deaths (WHO 2019). Public perception on influenza vaccines, associated risks and behaviours vary from year to year, between socioeconomic status groups, targeted risk groups, persons from different cultural backgrounds and from community to community. This makes it difficult for public health authorities and clinical providers to develop effective emergency preparedness, communications strategies to educate the public and to tailor their services.

Aims  Numerous studies examine vaccination uptake and try to understand why people are often reluctant to get an influenza vaccination (Larson et al. 2014; Jarrett et al. 2014; Strelitz et al. 2015). This study is unique as it is the largest household survey on influenza in Switzerland and it focuses not only on individual characteristics from the survey but also on geographic area variables. This thesis aims at gaining insights concerning:  Determinants of health related habits Health related habits and influenza-like illnesses Determinants of vaccination rates Determinants of vaccination hesitancy Identification of quarter effects - explaining urban quarter variability  Relevance The Federal Office for Public Health sees seasonal influenza as a serious disease, which leads to 112'000-275'000 annual doctor's consultations, thousands of hospitalisations due to illness-induced complications and several hundred deaths in Switzerland alone (BAG 2017b). This project has a high and direct relevance for persons of the city of Basel, because (1) influenza infection is a very common problem within the population and (2) an infection is associated with high morbidity, mortality and health care costs (Chen et al. 2015). Therefore, it is vital to lower the infection rates with influenza.

The project analyzes the obligations of insurance companies under counter-terrorism law and the contribution of insurance companies to counter-terrorism efforts.  Through a combined reading of insurance and counter-terrorism laws, shortcomings in each of the fields of the law can be cured. Insurance law provides a technical understanding of terrorism, which decreases the negative effects of the over-politicization in counter-terrorism law. Counter-terrorism law provides a theoretical background for the definition of terrorism and clarification of the obligations of insurance companies in the context of counter-terrorism. Such a harmonious understanding of terrorism enhances customer protection in insurance law and the effectiveness of the financial fight against terrorism in counter-terrorism law. There is only limited research in the intersection between insurance and counter-terrorism laws. The project fills this literature gap with intradisciplinarity by combining the two fields. Comparative legal methodology, concretely the functional comparativism, combined with expert interviews is the methodology of the project. For this project, counter-terrorism law refers to domestic, regional and international regulations, which aims to suppress the phenomenon of terrorism financially, criminally and administratively.",NA,own_funding,Active,4528714,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,933,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE
"Locher, Miriam; Loew, Joelle",NA,Departement Sprach- und Literaturwissenschaften / English Linguistics (Locher),On identities and gender at work: a linguistic case study of agile IT,2018,"While it has been widely acknowledged in academic and practitioner literature that increasing diversity in IT through inclusion of women is an ongoing priority, recent studies of IT workplaces in Europe and the US have found recurrent themes of gender discrimination cutting across different cultural contexts, including Switzerland and the UK (e.g. Schwab et al., 2020). In software development and project management in these contexts, agile ways of working are increasingly becoming the norm (Meyer, 2014). 'Agile' encompasses a number of practices and processes which put an emphasis on facilitating open and frequent communication, empowering teams, reducing hierarchies and foregrounding interpersonal and relational aspects of professional communication. This, in turn, has been argued to reduce (masculine) power structures (Barke, 2015; Boes et al., 2018), yet the field of IT in Euro-Western contexts remains largely male dominated. Furthermore, counter to the importance of communication to agile ways of working (e.g. Hummel et al., 2015), linguistic research on this phenomenon remains scarce, specifically with regard to gender issues. The present study thus takes a linguistic approach to agile ways of working in IT by way of an in-depth qualitative case study of different sociocultural contexts, including Switzerland, the UK, and the US. It deploys frameworks from linguistics at the intersection of discourse analysis, interactional sociolinguistics and identity construction to investigate agile ways of working through a gender lens. The dissertation draws on multiple data sources including over 52 hours of recordings of team and one-to-one meetings from a UK company, and semi-structured interviews with 21 IT professionals from Switzerland, the UK and the US; to explore the intricate relationship between gender, professional and personal identities at the interface of competing gendered discourses in the field of agile IT. Applying and refining current conceptualizations of gender in workplace discourse, the dissertation differentiates between different gender orders to capture the intricate and manifold processes of the gendering of work both in talk about work, and talk at work. Detailing how gendered practices are enacted and constructed by participants, the project enhances academic understanding of linguistic practices that construct agile IT workplaces as gendered on multiple levels. It thereby contributes to ongoing debates on the gendering of the IT industry specifically, and the gendering of work more globally, which in turn can provide much needed insight into persistent gender inequalities in the field.","identity construction, workplace discourse, gender, agile, interactional sociolinguistics",own_funding,Active,4486876,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,934,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Whereas previous studies investigating long-term effects of exercise on executive function have mainly focused on closed-skill sports, potential benefits of open-skill sports have largely been ignored. Within this sports category, martial arts are suggested to have a high potential for the elicitation of such cognitive enhancements. Purpose: The study aims to examine the effects of a 12-week martial arts program on executive function in adolescents. Possible benefits are investigated on a neurocognitive level to gain insights on the subtle processes that may contribute to exercise-induced enhancements within this cognitive domain. Additionally, the association between changes in neurophysiological indices of executive function and gains in motor skills as well as aerobic fitness are examined. Method: The study utilizes a randomized-controlled design, in which 56 adolescents are allocated to a martial arts group or a (wait-list) control group. Whereas the control group is encouraged to maintain their usual sports participation, a 12-week martial arts program with 2 sessions per week is prescribed to the other group. Prior to and after the intervention period, computer-based versions of the Go/NoGo task and the Change Detection task are administered. Simultaneously, event-related brain potentials (ERP) related to inhibitory processing (N200, P300) and working memory capacity (CDA) are recorded via electroencephalography.

Notably, the risk is related to a range of psychiatric disorders and not exclusively to the disorder diagnosed in the parent, indicating that a transdiagnostic staging approach is going to be necessary. A key challenge in research on the early detection of psychiatric disorders is to distinguish those who are going to develop the disorder from those who will not. However, the accuracy of clinical assessment instruments to predict risk propensity in young high-risk individuals is limited because they do not capture relevant pathophysiological mechanisms. Therefore there is urgent need to find complementary data such as biological variables to improve risk prediction in young people at high-risk for developing a psychiatric disorder. Brain imaging has emerged as a powerful tool to map direct neurobiological processes associated with the development of the illness. Numerous imaging studies have demonstrated that psychiatric disorders are associated with structural and functional brain abnormalities, which are already evident in the early stages of the disorder. More recent brain network studies suggest a more fine-grained interpretation by revealing that brain abnormalities in psychiatric disorders are not solely attributable to changes in local regions and connections but rather emerge from changes in the topology of the network as a whole, the connectome of the brain. These network findings indicate that many mental disorders may be best understood in terms of brain network dysfunction rather then by localized 'lesions'. Moreover, it has been shown that psychiatric disorders often share underlying brain network pathology, which makes traditional diagnostic boundaries less meaningful. Variability in the configuration of the brain connectome may lead to variability in symptom expression and thereby producing transdiagnostic symptoms The purpose of this project is to test the clinical utility of structural and functional whole-brain network markers to predict risk propensity in children and adolescents with an increased risk for developing schizophrenia and depression. In particular, we will investigate using graphical theoretical analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data whether complex measures of the brain connectome at initial baseline assessments can predict clinical and psychological features at follow-up assessments in offspring of parents with schizophrenia and depression. The results of this project may allow individual risk stratification and the development personalized preventive interventions in individuals at high-risk for mental illnesses.

The ExAMIN Youth SA study aims to investigate the impact of lifestyle behaviors (physical fitness/activity, dietary intake and psychosocial factors) involved in early vascular aging among South African children. Methods: This study is an analytical, multidisciplinary, observational cohort study in a school-based setting. We aim to phenotype a cohort of ~1,000 primary school children (black and white boys and girls between ages 5-9 years) based on current clinical childhood conditions including hypertension and obesity. The primary phenotype is large artery stiffness and retinal microvascular diameters, both biomarkers of early vascular aging. The risk factors and mediators of early vascular aging and also responsible for the clinical conditions include physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, and life stress. Additionally, urinalysis and salivary analyses will be performed to identify biomarkers related to the pathophysiology of early vascular aging. Discussion: In line with the growing prevalence of obesity and hypertension responsible for the development of early vascular aging from childhood to adulthood, this study will address the critical areas in which we observe unfavorable arterial modulation related to dietary behaviors, physical inactivity, and early life stress.

The project's focus will lie on Benedictines and Canonesses in modern-day Germany, France, Switzerland, and Belgium whose convents were richly endowed, not only in terms of land, but also in terms of legal and religious rights. In the Holy Roman Empire, the heads of imperial abbacies possessed far-ranging powers, including suffrage in the Imperial Diet. In France, female houses grew trans-regionally and formed monastic orders with numerous filiations. Abbesses in France and the Empire administrated vast lands where they oversaw agricultural labor, manufacturing, and trade; they exercised low, middle, and even high justice (either directly or via delegates), and appointed priests to the parish churches under their jurisdiction. Being elected to the head of a nunnery meant frequent interactions with the world beyond the cloister, a world in which these abbesses habitually practiced power and thus contributed to shaping it. Scholars of medieval Europe have underestimated the active roles of women religious in shaping their world both within and beyond the cloister. The findings of this project will allow us to reassess not only the role of women religious in medieval Europe, but also the fundamentals of medieval society itself, in which (aristocratic) women religious enjoyed far greater independent social, political and religious influence than scholarship has hitherto allowed.","monasticism, feudal age, culture of medieval Europe",own_funding,Active,4334375,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,949,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Large-scale engineering projects always come with a string of risks attached: financial, risks economic risks, performance risks, social and environmental risks and, last but not least, political risks. While the risk environment of large-scale projects is already high under normal circumstances, many argue that connective infrastructure projects across Eurasia are delivered under circumstances that make them highly susceptible to political risks. This is the case, because many projects that are incorporated in connectivity initiatives, such as China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), are financed by foreign banks and delivered by foreign state-owned-enterprises (SOEs). This practice produces a host of dependencies (commercial, logistical, technical, financial, legal) between the connectivity provider and its connectivity receiver that can be leveraged into political influence. Especially the Chinese practice of connective infrastructure provision in Eurasia has invited much criticism. It has often been framed as a case of geo-economics, meaning as an attempt to gain access to and control over flows of goods, infrastructures and markets and to attain political influence over connected states. The study systematically analyzes the Chinese practice of connective infrastructure provision in Eurasia on a project level. Based on a qualitative analysis of project data, it contributes to the ongoing conversation by providing answers to the question, who benefits from such projects? A small number of case studies weighs risks against benefits of China's unilateral practice of connective infrastructure provision. It tries to assess China's performance record in project delivery and to investigate patterns of political leverage that is applied for geo-economic goals. A key task will be to analyze in how far such practice actually produces connectivity that can be converted into economic benefits for participating states.  ","connectivity, Eurasia, One Belt One Road, infrastructure",own_funding,Active,4493829,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,954,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

This process applies also to diseases of the cardiovascular system, including heart failure, which is a widespread syndrome in middle-aged and older people. Although life expectancy has steadily increased in past decades, the traditional curative way of thinking in medicine is unlikely to compress the disease phase to the final stage of life and thus increase the health span, which is defined as a period of relatively disease-free aging followed by a period of age-related diseases and disabilities. In the period of healthy aging, the function of the organs, including the cardiovascular system, is already deteriorating. To counteract this process and to increase the health span, the preservation or improvement of components of physical fitness (endurance capacity, muscle strength, and neuromuscular function) is thought to be an essential element. The proven, independently predictive value of the single physical fitness components for total and cardiovascular mortality confirms this assumption. However, comprehensive data regarding individual physical fitness characteristics over the course of life are not yet available. Such data is necessary for any targeted prevention program with physical activity and exercise training as crucial pillars. Furthermore, healthy reference values could be used to estimate the adaptive capacity in healthy individuals compared to patients. Therefore, the aims of the COmPLETE project are:1.To determine the trajectories of physical fitness components of healthy aging by measurement of endurance capacity, muscular strength and neuromuscular coordination in a healthy population sample between 20 and 100 years (COmPLETE-Health) and 2.To determine the health distance between healthy individuals (COmPLETE-Health) and heart failure patients (COmPLETE-Heart) on the basis of different physical fitness components (endurance capacity, muscular strength and neuromuscular coordination). We anticipate that, for the first time, a basis for targeted prevention programs will be created through better and comprehensive knowledge of the individual physical fitness to improve the health span. In addition, we are convinced that by calculating the health distance between healthy and heart failure patients, we are laying the foundation for more individual exercise therapy.

Having long opposed struggles for democratic reform, even at the cost of the traumatic loss of the revolutionary 'hinterland' in 1833, these families eventually, in 1875, relinquished their political monopoly, yet retained economic and symbolic power (Sarasin 1997). Hence, there is, first, a complex constellation of continuity and discontinuity, comprising the kind of crisis-laden ""triggering events"" that have been identified as constituting the ""matrix"" of genealogical work (Jettot &amp; Lezowski 2016, 18-22). Secondly, Basel presents us with the case of a society where a close-knit network of kin groups was a crucial 'mover of modernity', a modernity that has long been falsely associated with the declining importance of kinship (Sabean &amp; Teuscher 2007). This constellation provides an ideal setting for further examining the tendency of the middle classes to adapt the genealogical enterprise of a bygone nobility for the maintenance of social hierarchies by purging it of its mythical contents (Timm 2016; Hohkamp 2018), thus constituting a historical bridgehead between 'old' noble and 'new' generalized forms of genealogy (Bouquet 1996). However, applying the overall approach of the Sinergia project, the subproject will open up additional pathways for research: Examining the actors, the work, and technologies that went into the production of bourgeois family trees, as well as the uses of the diagrams, f.e. in the context of socialization, might bring to light the conceptual productivity of bourgeois ""family treeing"" (Edwards 2017) beyond social mimicry and iconological continuation: What is actually produced through family trees? Relations among the living or relations between the living and the dead? How do family trees structure sociality by abstracting from relationships with those diagrammatically excluded, and how do they concretize what counts as kin? How does the very production of genealogical data and the crafting of trees itself generate relationships among those involved? This study will furthermore specifically pay attention to the gender aspect by not only analyzing how the patrilineal order is diagrammatically (re-)presented, but also by asking how the production of diagrams negotiated the (possibly contentious) gendered structure of descent and transmission. At the basis of the study are two sets of sources held by the public record office of Basel (Staatsarchiv Basel): 1) the large collection of representative family trees dating from the late 18th up to the middle of the 20th cen., and 2) the documentation of their making as preserved in family estates.",NA,own_funding,Active,4530606,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,969,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Pathological Genealogies,2019,"Das Dissertationsprojekt ist Teil des Sinergiaprojektes ""Genealogical diagrams"" Psychiatric institutions and their assiduously systematic collection of patient data played an essential role in the formation of nineteenth-century conceptions of inheritance. Empirical and statistical evidence pointing towards the heritability of psychic pathologies in families grew throughout the 19th century (Porter 2018). By 1900, recently rediscovered Mendelian rules seemed to provide a mechanism for the transmission of properties and even promised to allow for prognoses (Gausemeier 2008). But what did it mean to be pathologically related to fellow human beings? How would parent and child become companions in disease? The project concerns the previously unexplored topic of pathological kinship. This gap is both historiographic and historical-historiographic in so far as among the vast research on concepts of heredity there are hardly any studies that treat ""kinship"" as an epistemological category within the sciences of heredity; historical in the sense that the psychiatric science of heredity did not critically reflect on ""kinship"" as a subject but assumed it as given in nature. Thus, building on the findings of new kinship studies, one can argue that ""kinship"" cannot be presupposed precisely where that concept is in use (Carsten 2004). A case study from around 1925-1928, when Ernst Rüdin directed the psychiatric clinic in the city of Basel, will show that exactly in this presumed gap were an abundance of practices to negotiate and especially produce supposedly unproblematic ""kinship."" The central source base consists of patient dossiers from the Heil- und Pflegeanstalt Friedmatt, which contain admission forms including a family history and detailed genealogical questionnaires. Such sources raise questions of the reciprocity between knowledge of psychiatric inheritance and retrospective narration; of objectivization and the production of relationships and kinship structures; and especially of the informing of medical personnel through Mendelian and genealogical diagrams of families and heredity.

Notwithstanding humour's perceived lower status of humour within literary genres, humorous, and sometimes lewd, poems, have never ceased to be written, including by high-brow poets, and humorous devices are often used in serious poetry, with or without a comic effect. One must wonder how versification is used to produce or enhance humour, what the consequences of using verse in humorous texts are, and examine the wealth of practices and results behind this association, from rich, dark humour to silly-sounding satire. Humour and versification both rely on a disruption of the bona fidecommunication, require a precise mastery of the timing, rhythm, and contextual or intertextual complexities, value the unexpected and depend on a certain degree of familiarity. Both seek to impact the receiver not through the exactness of meaning but through the slipperiness of language, taking advantage of its inherent ambiguities and shortcomings.

"Elger, Bernice Simone","De Clercq, Eva; Roth, Volker",Ethik / Bio- und Medizinethik (Elger),Trusting Black-Box Algorithms? Ethical Challenges for Biomedical Machine Learning,2019,"The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into everyday life will deeply reshape many areas of society. Also within the medical domain, applying machine learning (ML) techniques on health-related data promises paradigm-shifting advances. More accurate and efficient diagnostic tools, personalised therapeutic regimes as well as prognostic or predictive measures are bound to improve the treatments of patients. Yet, while many authors have voiced general ethical concerns, in-depth ethical analysis of biomedical machine learning is still nascent.    Intricate ethical questions arise when the very design of a program renders it opaque to human understanding. Artificial neural networks employed for Deep Learning (DL) can serve as a classic example for this. In DL, programs can find their own, multi-layered representations based on vast training data, allowing the program to find novel patterns in the data. In practice, this can be of great value if it renders a program's predictions and decisions more accurate or allows for new and improved scientific descriptions of a phenomenon. However, such novel forms of representations, recognizing patterns yet undetected and potentially undetectable by human agents, often make it impossible to fully explain and understand these so-called ""black boxes"".   In clinical contexts, such opacity poses particular ethical challenges. How can we address so-called responsibility gaps, created by complex interactions between human agents and black-box algorithms, if a program's recommendation is erroneous and endangers patients? How can informed consent be obtained to use a program if it is by principle incomprehensible to both patients and health care professionals? How can we avoid discrimination against socially salient groups and protect vulnerable populations from systematic bias without understanding the underlying computational processes?    A popular strategy to tackle these challenges is to call for trust in AI. After all, trust can be a means to deal pragmatically with uncertainty and incomplete knowledge in complex societies - and is generally considered to be of vital importance in healthcare settings. Taking trust as a starting point, this project hence asks if and under which conditions we can and should trust medical black boxes, bringing together theoretical considerations and empirical analysis informed by semi-structured qualitative interviews.

Limited feedback on person-centred care from residents' perspectives means that changes in care are being implemented without a comprehensive understanding of what is required to benefit resident quality of life. To fully understand person-centred care in relation to quality of life, it is necessary to integrate multiple, qualitative perspectives as well as addressing the complexities of care contexts. Long-term residential care facilities are not only medical service providers, but also provide a home environment for older adults. As such they should consider resident perceptions based on the environment they are living in, in relation to expectations, needs and standards. This means moving away from providing basic and safe care towards care that maintains functional ability as well as dignity and wellbeing to benefit resident quality of life.   Objectives: This study aims to gain a qualitative understanding of quality of life, particularly focussing on social relationships, and the impact of person-centred care on quality of life in long-term residential care using an ethnographic study design. In addition, this study allows exploration of resident quality of life from the viewpoint of multiple actors in long-term residential care. Methods: This project consists of a review, followed by a qualitative multi-case study in long-term residential care across three European countries (Switzerland, United Kingdom and Nederlands). The review, a meta-ethnography, allows an inductive and interpretive approach to compare ideas presented in previous literature while generating themes. Ethnographic methods (observations, interviews and document analysis) used for data collection in each case study, allows the researchers to gather information in a natural setting. Information will be analysed from each individual case studies independently. Independent data from each will then be synthesised to explore the impact of a person-centred organisational culture on quality of life in long-term residential care.   ","long-term residential care, nursing home, person-centered care, quality of life, interprofessional collaboration, integrated care",own_funding,Active,4528063,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,981,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Increased in globalization has made TCK more common in recent years.Very often, TCK are confronted with new challenges such as struggling with a sense of belonging, identity formation, adapting to new school, and making new friends. It also allows TCK to experience acculturation, a dual process of cultural and psychological change that takes place as a result of contact between two or more cultural groups (Berry, 2005). By living in different cultures, TCK have the opportunities to develop skills to manage and adapt to changes, to be more openand accepting to different cultures and experiences (Pollock, Van Reken &amp; Pollock, 2017). The ability to successfully adjust to this new environment can enrich TCK's lives (Kempen et al., 2015), while failure to manage these challenges can result in psychological well-being consequences (Brown, 2008). On the other hand, within the human resources literature, the most frequently reported reason for failed expatriate relocation was the inability/unwillingness of a partner (e.g., the parent of TCK) to adapt to the foreign environment and giving up their careers (Haslberger &amp; Brewster, 2008; Lazarova et al., 2015), resulting in increased psychosocial distress (Silbiger &amp; Pines, 2014), depression (Magdol, 2002), and lower marriage satisfaction (Lazarova et al., 2015).As such, it is important to examine factors that may promote positive well-being and adjustment in TCK and their families. Our longitudinal study comprises a mixed approach of quantitative and qualitiative design to answer the following questions: 1. What are the roles of emotion regulation, self-esteem, resilience, and negative self-thoughts in changes to TCK's well-being and sociocultural adjustment over time? 2.

To this end, we will use 2-photon calcium imaging to monitor the activity of large populations of MEC-L2 neurons in head-fixed mice running on a wheel in darkness, in the absence of external sensory feedback tuned to navigation.

Following Aristotle's ideal of science as guided by first principles and following the division of his works, natural philosophy is seen as the study of the whole of nature, i.e. all physically existing things that undergo motion. By the early 17th century, there are an increasing number of voices that challenge Aristotle's status as the central philosophical authority. Within these debates, motion is an important point of contention, because in the Aristotelian tradition, the concept of motion encompasses but also any kind of change in physical things.The project examines the texts of four Anti-Aristotelians published in the 1620s: Sebastian Basson, David Gorleus, Daniel Sennert and Francis Bacon. It starts from a narrow question: The motion of what kind of thing explains observable everyday motions? Because Aristotle remains a constant fixture, an author's stance on motion will affect his stance on a number of issues related to motion in Aristotle's system, e.g. matter theory, the possibility of teleological arguments and the disciplinary unity of natural philosophy. For this reason, the issue of motion also provides insights into the problems motivating the search for a new philosophy of nature that was so famously successful later in the century. The 1620s are an especially interesting moment in in this development, as the fundamental problems are clear but it is an open question what the best solution could be. The four authors whose texts are under consideration here exemplify all of this. In keeping with the general eclecticism of the period, there are no positive tenets to unite all four authors and distinguish them from all forms of Aristotelianism. The approach taken here is to compare the texts as four synchronous positions on motion which are unified prima facie only in their negative attitude towards Aristotelianism. This does not privilege any one explanation of their similarities or dissimilarities from the outset. A benefit of this method is that it helps to navigate the difficult historiography of the question: One must not fall into the trap of assuming a specific development as essential to all 17th century innovators, as has been claimed from various sides for the ""mechanical philosophy"", the abolishing of substantial forms, the victory of empiricism or mathematization.

Previous studies have shown interest in generational analysis, focusing special attention on linguistic changes and evolution. Those analyses register an almost-exclusive use of Spanish among the oldest generation and a drastic switch to English (official language) among the youngest generation. The use of English, not only in official and formal situations, but also in a familiar context, seems to be accompanied by the loss of Spanish among the young (Kellerman 2001; Moyer 1992; Weston 2013). However, no much research has been done on either a comprehensive analysis of bilingualism and its connection to language attitudes and identity, or on the language of younger generations.   This project focuses on getting an understanding of the linguistic situation among the young population in Gibraltar.

Most of these reforms affected the Empire's administrative structures, the organization of the provinces, as well as the administration of its many cities. Scholars in the past considered these reforms to have spelled the «total regulation of urban affairs by the state» and ultimately the end of local autonomy. Indeed, the boule, the central institution of local self-government, and some of the cities «traditional» magistrates gradually started to disappear from the papyri of the 4th century. Their political power, it seems, diminished increasingly. However, officials like the logistes or the exactor, who, in the course of the Diocletianic or Constantinian reforms, had been placed at the head of municipal administration, were recruited from the ranks of the local elite. As various papyri thus suggest, the essential responsibilities had been shifted from a collective to a well-chosen board of individual magistrates of the local elite, who ultimately answered not only directly to the prefect but at times were also able to «monopolize» their social and political standing. Presumably, a development which finally led to a hierarchical differentiation within the boule and the entire urban elite has had a severe impact on councillors of lesser standing, being increasingly degraded to an «upper middle class.»This doctoral research therefore aims not only at illuminating this process in more detail but also at tackling various questions that arise accordingly. The rise of a new civic elite would have had a major impact on the life of every single member of the social elite. Thus, it is necessary to look at various developments which so far have only been studied unsatisfactorily - such as the accumulation of landholding during the 4th century, the so-called «flight» of the curiales or the decline in municipal euergetism. The ancient polis, it seems, has lost its importance as a focal point for some parts of the upper strata.

In order to directly compare cost efficiencies across treatment groups, I use a stochastic meta frontier (SMF) analysis. I provide additional evidence of the causal impact of the EU ETS on various types of firms` costs with a difference-in-differences (DD) framework. My results indicate that the EU ETS regulation has resulted in a small but significant increase in costs across the German manufacturing sector. This increase is driven mostly by an increase in energy and capital costs. I demonstrate that the potential to increase cost efficiency exists for most industries in the German manufacturing sector. The analysis of the drivers of cost efficiency confirms that in most industries, exporting firms are more cost efficient than their counterparts.

However, ""While motherhood is often a positive and fulfilling experience, for too many women it is associated with suffering, ill-health and even death."" Possible health conditions such as puerperal psychosis, dizziness, fever, anaemia, postpartum hemorrhage, high blood pressure, eclampsia pulmonary, infection among others accounted for high rate of maternal mortality recorded in many African countries. The basis of Africans' reaction to western medicine might, in addition to other factors, have been guided by their use of and the perceived potency of established indigenous medical practices that predated the introduction of Western medicine in their communities. It is imperative this research examine the interface between African worldviews, as they relate to health and illness at the time Western medicine was introduced and used widely in southwest Nigeria. The ways by which Africans continued to appreciate their established medical practices, yet at the same time using, in different ways, Western medicine is important as it demonstrate their own agency within the colonial context that sought to narrow Africans' choices by condemning traditional healers' medical practices as unscientific, anti-Christian and primitive. Throughout most of the nation's history, the importance of traditional medicine had largely been ignored for centuries because of its primitive method within the medical system. Recently, this logic has been undermined as women's patronage of traditional medicine has dramatically increased. The view that maternal health was shaped by issues such as cultural, racial, and religious differences; the pace of medical professionalization; the general education of the African population; and the degree of financial investment into colonial health after World War II also remain largely unexplored.

"Hoch, Günter",NA,Departement Umweltwissenschaften / Physiological Plant Ecology (Kahmen),Cold root effects on water-uptake and C-relations in temperate tree species,2019,"Previous studies indicated that low root zone temperatures can induce drought-like water shortage in trees, with severe consequences also for their C-household. The restricted water conductivity of roots cannot be explained by the increased viscosity of water at cold temperatures alone. The very high sensitivity against non-freezing, colder root temperatures rather suggests that the water uptake of roots is likely stronger dependent on active processes (e.g. via aquaporins) than is generally assumed. Cold root temperature induced drought-like stress might thus contribute to the observed growth restriction of trees at their cold limits. In this 4-year PhD project, we will built upon recent experiments at the University of Basel to deepen our understanding of cold root zone effects on temperature trees. We will investigate seedlings of different temperate tree species at warm air temperatures and different root temperatures by means of a temperature-controlled water bath system. Water- and nitrogen-uptake, as well as carbon assimilation at different root temperatures will be quantified by pulse labelling with stable isotopes (2H-H2O and 15N-NO3enriched water, 13C-CO2 enriched air). Especially, we will address the following questions:  Is the water uptake capacity of tree species with low elevational distribution limits more sensitive to low root zone temperatures than in species with high elevation distribution limits? Is the strong restriction of the phloem C-transport at cold root temperatures leading to accumulated non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) reserves in the aboveground tissue of tree seedlings?

Pathogens such as the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, commonly found in hospitals, are the cause of a great variety of infections that affect several parts of the human body, leading to death if the infection is not treated properly.The bacterial cell wall is a complex structure that exerts important protective functions against host defenses and antibiotics allowing bacterial survival and adaptation under adverse conditions. One of the most distinct features of the cell wall from Gram-positive bacteria is the presence of teichoic acids biopolymers. These polymers have been shown to be important for immune evasion, adhesion, biofilm formation and protection from antimicrobials. Despite the great importance of teichoic acids, mechanistic and fundamental biochemical aspects of membrane proteins participating in their assembly are poorly described. Understanding how such proteins work will have a tremendous impact on the design of novel vaccines against Gram-positive bacteria and to generate further antimicrobials. In this project we seek to develop two strategies that will allow us to fight Gram-positive bacterial infections. The first strategy is to develop novel chemoenzymatic routes for the production of alternative conjugate vaccines derived from teichoic acids. To do this, we first need to understand how the proteins involved in teichoic acids synthesis perform polymerization and assembly of these biopolymers. By understanding these processes, we will be able to engineer these proteins and to generate conjugate ensembles that will differ from classic capsular polysaccharide-derived vaccines, opening new alternatives for vaccination against S. aureus and other Gram-positive pathogens. The second strategy is to characterize disaccharide inhibitors targeting the flippase LtaA, a central protein in lipoteichoic acids assembly pathway. Recently, my lab found that LtaA is essential for survival of S. aureus under host niche conditions. We have generated preliminary data showing that some disaccharide molecules inhibit the activity of LtaA with high specificity. We want to investigate the mechanism of LtaA inhibition by disaccharide molecules. We believe that by doing this, we will be able to discover novel alternatives for the treatment of S. aureus infections. Our research will be of fundamental, groundbreaking impact to understand cell wall biology, activity modulation and inhibition of teichoic acids assembly pathways, and will reveal new routes for the design of conjugated vaccines. Our work will establish a framework that will allow development of treatments to counteract Gram-positive bacterial infections in the future.","Staphylococcus aureus, teichoic acids, conjugated vaccines, antibiotics",own_funding,Active,4523847,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,1017,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Since rainfall is almost non-existent in Middle and Upper Egypt, any changes in the annual Nile flood must have triggered an immediate response in Egyptian society, economy and politics. Moreover, the Nile river and its fertile flood plains did not only play a crucial role in the development of Egyptian civilization, but they also constituted one of the main pillars for the economic stability of the Roman Empire and helped to sustain its imperial expansion. The grain supply of the city of Rome and the Roman army was closely tied to the annual cycle of the Egyptian river. Reconstructing annual changes in the quality of the flood of the Nile is thus important not only for studying the immediately adjacent Egyptian society, but it also has implications of a larger scale, for a series of below-average Nile floods must have had serious political and socio-economic consequences for the entire Roman Empire.

Modulation of the hepatic clearance has been shown to affect the plasma concentration of drugs and to be associated with numerous drug-drug interactions (DDIs). To meet the risk of drug-induced adverse events pharmaceutical companies are requested to test new molecular entities for interaction with drug transporters in early drug development. In recent years, there is an increasing interest in identifying suitable endogenous biomarkers to assess the risk of transporter-mediated DDIs. Currently coproporphyrin I and III (CPI and CPIII, also referred to as CPs), are under investigation for their suitability as biomarkers to predict OATP1B interaction. CPs are anionic porphyrin byproducts of heme biosynthesis and eliminated by hepatobiliary and renal excretion. Both clinical and in vitro studies performed with rifampicin, a potent inhibitor of the organic anion excretion route in liver revealed the biomarkers as suitable tool to predict transporter-involving DDIs. This also includes the OATP1B-transporters in liver. However, further investigations on selectivity and sensitivity are warranted, to gain confidence in the applicability of CPs as clinical OATP1B biomarkers. Two members of the major facilitator superfamily of transporter proteins, Heme Carrier Protein 1 (HCP1, SLC46A1 gene) and Feline Leukemia Virus Subgroup C Receptor-Related Protein 2 (FLVCR2, gene SLC49A2), are expressed in human liver and reported to facilitate the transport of porphyrin derivatives such as heme, protoporphyrin IX, and mesoporphyrins. Whether theses porphyrin transporters are also involved in the cellular handling of CPs has not been investigated to date. Using immunohistology and Western Blot analysis, we will first investigate expression and localization of HCP1 and FLVCR2 protein in human liver. Next, we will examine their transport function using the vaccinia virus-based heterologous expression system, vTF-7, in HeLa cells and CPI or CPIII as substrates. In parallel, we will validate the expression of both transporters in these cells using Western Blot analysis. If we observe a significant intracellular accumulation of CPs in our transport experiments, we will continue analyzing the Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters, Km and Vmax, and the impact of rifampicin on HCP1- or FLVCR2-mediated uptake of CPs. Besides its inhibitory effect on OATP1B transport rifampicin has been shown to induce the expression of certain cytochrome P450 metabolizing enzymes and efflux transporters in a pregnane X receptor (PXR)-mediated manner. Applying HepaRG, a cell line showing close characteristics of primary human hepatocytes and expressing basically all nuclear receptors, we aim to investigate the effect of rifampicin on HCP1 and FLVCR2 mRNA expression.","Organic anion transporting polypeptide, OATP1B, coproporphyrin, biomarker, HCP1, FLVCR2, liver",own_funding,Active,4612786,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,1023,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Barriers to healthcare access for migrant children have been described for the Swiss context. Reasons for this health inequity, amongst others, are the structuring of the healthcare system (e.g. insufficient migrant orientation) or formal access barriers (e.g. travel distances and geographical location). Furthermore, for Switzerland it is known that pediatric oncology providers face difficulties in shared decision-making due to cultural aspects of families from different origins (e.g. religiously determined illness understandings) as well as the challenge to provide individually tailored and culturally appropriate care to all children and families. However, it is imperative that the migrant population has reasonable access to pediatric oncology care and that they receive culturally competent pediatric oncology care. Moreover, the imperative to study barriers to culturallyequitable pediatric oncology care in Switzerland is both an ethical and a medical one, because access to healthcare is a fundamental human right and, ultimately, good health of migrant children leads to better overall population health. Thus, the proposed research project aims to better understand the existing cultural barriers in pediatric oncology in Switzerland by (a) identifying the key cross-cultural competences for pediatric oncology providers, (b) examining pediatric oncology providers' cross-cultural competences, and (c) analyzing cultural minorities' access of specialized pediatric oncology care. The study is composed of three empirical modules which enable us to address our guiding research questions. Thus, we will obtain different but complementary data.

These range from practical solutions to engineering problems to cosmic structure formation and evolution. In that respect, numerical simulations of fluids in astrophysics and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) are among the most computationally demanding calculations in terms of sustained floating-point operations per second (FLOP/s). It is expected that they will benefit greatly from the future Exascale computing infrastructures, that will perform 1018 FLOP/s. This type of scenarios pushes the computational astrophysics and CFD fields well into sustained Exascale computing. Nowadays, they can only be tackled by either reducing the scale, the resolution and/or the dimensionality of the problem, or using approximated versions of the physics involved. How this affects the outcome of the simulations, and therefore our knowledge on the problem, is still not well understood. The simulation codes used in numerical astrophysics and CFD (hydrocodes, hereafter) are numerous and varied. Most of them rely on a hydrodynamics solver that calculates the evolution of the system to be studied along with all the coupled physics. Among these hydrodynamics solvers, the Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) technique is a purely Lagrangian method, with no subjacent mesh, where the fluid can freely move in a practically boundless domain, this being very convenient for astrophysics and CFD simulations. SPH codes are very important in astrophysics because they couple naturally with the fastest and most efficient gravity solvers such as tree-code and fast multiple methods. Nevertheless, the parallelization of SPH codes is not straightforward due to its boundless nature and the lack of a structured grid, causing continuously changing interactions between fluid elements or between fluid elements and mechanical structures, from one time-step to the next. This, indeed, poses an additional layer of complexity in parallelizing SPH codes, yet it also renders them a very attractive and challenging application for the computer science community in view of its parallelization and scalability challenges for the upcoming Exascale computing systems. We aim in this project to have a scalable and fault-tolerant SPH kernel, developed into a mini/proxy co-design application.

During my PhD I demonstrated that underground storage pits are a reliable source of information when their capacity is used as a proxy for productivity at a household scale using large datasets covering long time periods and geographic areas, as big data. Nevertheless, the validity of this proxy at a more local level still needs to be developed, since preservation quality is variable in archaeological sites and this limits the calculation of realistic original storage volume, which is a key aspect I want to resolve before starting a new research project where productivity is put at the centre of analysis of changes in socio-economic dynamics and inequality at the transition between the Neolithic and the Bronze Age, with the new agricultural developments connected to new technology available.

This project will be co-funded by a smaller grant I will submit in June 2020 to the FAG (Freiwillige Akademische Gesellschaft) for the study of Basel-Gasfabrik site. I consider this as a key step in my career towards the consolidation of my line of research in the ideal research context of the University of Basel, particularly at the IPNA (Department of Environmental Sciences) where aspects about prehistoric farming, resilience, and social change have a long and solid tradition, facilitating thus the synergies between my project and existing datasets.",Prehistoric farming; Western Europe; site-scale analysis; productivity modelling,own_funding,Active,4496799,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,1031,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"Locher, Miriam; Ehrsam, Kristina",NA,Departement Sprach- und Literaturwissenschaften / English Linguistics (Locher),The Role of English as a Lingua Franca in the Foreign Language Classroom,2020,"Research on language use and learning during study abroad has primarily investigated students' use of the target language (TL) in a TL environment and the convergence of their TL skills towards a native speaker norm. To date, little is known about the multilingual practices that students engage in while studying abroad. From the perspective of multilingualism, contexts in which a local language is used, of which the students may have little or no previous knowledge, represents a fascinating case as students often heavily depend on English as a lingua franca (ELF) to interact with the host community and other international students. The present study aims to shed light on the role of ELF in mediating the learning of local languages in different ELF contexts. The goal is to investigate the extent to which ELF is employed in the foreign language classroom, by whom, under what circumstances and for what purposes. Additionally, the study aims at gaining a deeper understanding of course instructors' and students' attitudes toward the use of ELF in the foreign language classroom. Previous research on foreign language learning in the classroom has mainly focused on the role of students' first languages and the mobilization of other linguistic resources to enhance the language learning process. While the role of ELF for the English language classroom or the use of ELF as the medium of instruction in non-language courses continue to be discussed and investigated, the role of ELF as a mediating language for teaching and learning a third language remains underexplored (for exceptions, see Ife 2008; Wang 2013; Turnbull 2018). The present study aims to enhance our understanding of the use of ELF in local language courses offered at higher education institutions or language schools and targeted at international students with different linguistic backgrounds. To address the research questions, in a first step, videos of classroom interaction will be recorded, transcribed and analyzed focusing on incidents of ELF use. In a second step, reflexive online-interviews with the course instructors and students will be conducted. Excerpts of the videos will be used to discuss examples of actual ELF use in the classroom.","ELF, classrrom",own_funding,Active,4603232,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,1032,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"Gerardin, François",NA,Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences; Departement Altertumswissenschaften / Fachbereich Alte Geschichte,Antinoopolis: an Urban Biography of the Roman and Late Antique Worlds,2020,"The project aims to integrate textual and material data and develop new digital tools to bring back into life the sights and smells of Antinoopolis, a city from ancient Egypt in the Roman and late antique periods. By ancient historical standards, the evidence for this city is voluminous, with more than one thousand texts-inscriptions and texts from the manuscript tradition as well as papyri. Besides, continuing archaeological excavations at Antinoopolis make it one of the currently most prolific sites for Greco-Roman and Byzantine Egypt. In this documentation, the late antique data hold pride of place, with great potential for historical analysis in the longue durée. Cities and their people, from the Pharaonic to Islamic periods, have often been considered cogs and gears in the administration of Egypt and denied meaningful agency in the country's long-term evolution. At a series of workshops and international conferences, the project team will analyze the parameters for urban development in Roman and late antique Egypt so as to reverse this general perspective. More specifically, the PI will write an ""urban biography"" of an important site, in which all the available evidence will be brought to bear on broader questions of political, economic, cultural, and religious change-beyond the theme of the classical city's demise in Late Antiquity. In addition to a book monograph, peer-reviewed articles, and edited volumes, the tools for the integration, analysis, and visualization of the data pertaining to people-digital urban prosopography-and places-a GIS platform for the contextualization and interpretation of archaeological data-will make the results of the project easily searchable and widely accessible.

"Braschler, Brigitte",NA,Departement Umweltwissenschaften / Naturschutzbiologie (Baur),Revision of two ecologically and economically important ant groups in South Africa,2020,"Taxonomy has played an important role in diversity assessment. It provides an understanding of biodiversity components that are essential for making decisions on conservation and sustainable use and is also a foundation for phylogenetic studies. This field of study has played an important role in identifying and describing biodiversity, but the issue of cryptic species has posed many taxonomic challenges. In most taxonomic groups, species with subtle differences and high intraspecific variation are often misidentified when morphological data is not supported by other methods, for example, genetic data. The misidentification of ecologically important species may have a negative impact in conservation decision-making. In addition, overlooking the presence of a new invasive species could cause ecosystem collapse if not detected and controlled in time. This project is aiming to 1) resolve taxonomic challenges in two ant groups: Anoplolepis and the Camponotus fulvopilosus species-group including the production of updated identification keys for the species; and the description of six new species; 2) resolve the taxonomic challenges in these two ant genera using molecular data, with 285 specimens submitted for barcoding; 3) to understand and update the geographical distribution of species within Anoplolepis and the Camponotus fulvopilosus species-group; and 4) to investigate the distribution and abundance of an invasive ant species, A. gracilipes, and its potential impact on indigenous ant populations. A total of at least 1,500 new records will be added to the collection. In summary, this project will develop scarce skills such as the taxonomic identification and the descriptions of new species, the barcoding of specimens, and the overall revision of these two economically and ecologically important ant groups. The project is run by a group of eight researchers at various South African Universities and Museums and the University of Basel and is led by Charlene Janion-Scheepers (University of Cape Town).

"Traber, Denise",NA,Departement Gesellschaftswissenschaften / Politikwissenschaft (Traber),A Quantitative Textual Approach of the European Consensus Method of Interpretation in the European Court of Human Rights,2020,"The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has the final say in human rights protection in Europe. The Court has developed a method of interpretation, European consensus (EuC), which it can use to decide on morally, politically or socially sensitive issues. With this method, the Court assesses whether the common practice of European states, international actors, and other authorities leads to the emergence of new human rights standards. EuC allows the ECtHR to build standards in socially sensitive areas such as religious dress and social minorities protection. Despite its importance, there is little clarity on the meaning and function of EuC in legal scholarship.    What is the EuC? How does consensus function within the ECtHR system? How to build an appropriate measure in framework for EuC?    We take a pluri-disciplinary approach to define EuC and measure its use in ECtHR case law. By applying computational text analysis techniques often used in quantitative political science, we will construct and validate new measures of EuC. We combine expert human coding of legal texts done by human rights lawyers and computational approaches from social science for textual data. Our new measures will allow the team to determine both the nature and also the level of consensus in each judgment as well as identify the language that indicates consensus analysis in the first place. Once we have constructed these new measures, we will use them to test important questions in the literature such as whether the ECtHR is more likely to find consensus when human rights standards emerge in one set of countries rather than another, whether certain countries are more likely to disagree with a new emerging consensus as determined by the Court, whose views are reflected in consensus judgments, and finally, how consensus functions within the ECtHR system.","Political Science, Law, Computational Text Analysis, Human rights, European Court of Human Rights",own_funding,Active,4612902,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,1035,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
"Meyer zu Schwabedissen, Henriette","Brecht Brüngger, Karin; Mettler, Lina Giulietta",Departement Pharmazeutische Wissenschaften / Biopharmazie (Meyer zu Schwabedissen),Investigations on the impact of herbal extracts on intestinal handling of histamine,2020,"Histamine intolerance (HIT) is a common diagnosis with an estimated prevalence of 1% in the Western population. Patients suffering from HIT exposed to histamine present with various symptoms such as rhinal congestion, headache, tachycardia, diarrhea, urticaria, and eventually bronchoconstriction. Food-derived histamine is modulated by different mechanisms in the intestine. Two intestinal enzymes, diamine oxidase (DAO) and histamine-N-methyltransferase (HNMT), are reported to metabolize histamine. Moreover, transport proteins, such as Organic Cation Transporter 3 (OCT3) or Plasma Membrane Monoamine Transporters (PMAT), are believed to contribute to the transmembrane transport and thus the overall handling of histamine. Using an immortalized cell line originating from colon adenocarcinoma, Caco-2, we aim to elucidate the influence of herbal remedies used in clinics for their influence on the intestinal handling of histamine. In pre-experiments we successfully validated the expression of DAO and HNMT in Caco-2 cells. In a dose-finding experiment, we will first test a dilution series of herbal extracts in cell viability assays in order to exclude a negative effect on Caco-2 cell viability. Next we will investigate the effect of different concentrations of herbal extracts on DAO and HNMT mRNA and protein expression by real-time qPCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. Previously, it has been reported that Caco-2 cells exposed to heparin showed a significant increase in DAO release and DAO enzymatic activity. Accordingly, we will examine the effect of herbal extract on DAO content and DAO activity in the enriched secretome of Caco-2 cells applying Western blot analysis and a fluorometric DAO enzyme activity assay, respectively. Since herbal extract may potentially interact with the transcellular transport of food-derived histamine in the intestine, we will apply Caco-2 transwell transport studies to assess the influence on the uptake of radioactive [3H]-histamine as a tracer. Adding herbal extracts to the apical side of the transwell (representing the luminal side of the intestine) we will determine the apical-to-basal as well as the basal-to-apical transfer of histamine. Concluding we will perform transport interaction experiments testing for the impact of histamine handling by OCT3 or PMAT in presence or absence of herbal extracts. To investigate the role of OCT3 we will apply a MDCKII cell line stably expressing OCT3 (MDCKII-OCT3) and readily available in our laboratory. PMAT will be cloned from human brain cDNA. We will then use the vaccinia virus-assisted expression system to transiently overexpress PMAT in HeLa cells.","Histamine intolerance, Diamine oxidase, Histamine-N-methyltransferase, Organic Cation Transporter 3, Plasma Membrane Monoamine Transporter, Caco-2 cells",own_funding,Active,4612785,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,1036,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

The Riddarasaga at issue is known as Möttuls saga and it is the Norse amplified translation of the fabliau Le mantel mautaillié, a parody of the Arthurian literature. The research will also include the two later products of the transmission of such texts: the Skikkju rímur, which are the Icelandic late-medieval verse adaptation of the saga, and the French mise en prose of the fabliau which dates back to the Renaissance. Although most of the Translated Riddarasögur were probably done in Norway in the thirteenth century, the manuscripts in which we can read them today are all Icelandic and date back to the fourteenth - fifteenth century, or even later. This fact raises at least one main philological question we must deal with: what, in the texts, is attributable to the translators? And what to the Icelandic copyists? This research will combine a philological study based on the critical editions and the manuscript tradition of the texts with the descriptive perspective of Even-Zohar's polysystem theory.

To do so, we need to streamline the current workflow of sequential assays to discover first Abs that bind and then look within the pool of binders for neutralizing Abs. We propose an approach where virus-neutralizing Abs are discovered directly within 1-3 days from the pool of hundreds of thousands of Ab specificities that can be obtained from a human donor. This direct approach would not only result in a much speedier process but would also make the discovery process antigen-agnostic, allowing the discovery of neutralizing Abs without knowing their molecular viral target. MTx developed a microfluidic single-cell technology to create cognate recombinant Ab libraries that represent the Ab repertoires of donor B-cells in mammalian HEK cells with an unparalleled fidelity and comprehensiveness. These HEK cell libraries are robust and inherently antigen-agnostic and would be an ideal starting point for the direct discovery of virus-neutralizing Abs. We propose to develop a screening system where the HEK cell libraries are represented as single cell preparations in microfluidic droplets in which we will apply a stimuli-responsive induced release of the virus particle out of polymeric giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) after a defined period of time, in which the cell was allowed to produce protective Abs. The protection from virus infection and thus the presence of a virus-neutralizing Ab will be made visible through a fluorescent readout and the thus identified microfluidic droplet will be sorted using our established droplet sorter. We will show case the &#956;DIVA platform by screening for functional Abs against Cytomegalovirus (CMV). &#956;DIVA will streamline and thus accelerate the discovery of therapeutic Abs against a multitude of viruses, making it an optimal screening tool for future pandemic threats.","virus-netralizing antibodies, microfluidic technology, synthetic compartments, stimuli-responsivness",own_funding,Active,4602666,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,1039,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
