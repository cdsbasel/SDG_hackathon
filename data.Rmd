#### Preprocessing

The Sustainability Office of the University of Basel supplied data from two different databases containing information of the University's electronic research output (publications and projects). 

The publications dataset had to be processed to generate abstracts that could be searched using search queries in English:

<i>Publications</i>

1. The database included journal articles (N = 43,229), book items (chapters, 13,443), journal items (5,028), proceedings items (2,144), and books (1,897).
2. We selected publications with English titles (~85%) and DOI present (~80%) that were published between 2010 and 2020 (~60%) using a custom-made *R* script. About half of all publications remained.    
3. We identified abstracts for all publications using <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rscopus/index.html">rscopus</a>. About ~85% of abstracts could be retrieved.    

<i>Publications & Projects</i>

1. Team members identified faculty-level organizational units within the University of Basel (including associated and cross-disciplinary institutes) manually, using the [descriptors](https://edoc.unibas.ch/view/divisions/) currently in use at the University of Basel. 
2. We used translations of the SDG queries of [Elsevier](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/87txkw7khs/1) (Jayabalasingham, Boverhof, Agnew & Klein, 2019) and the <a href="https://github.com/Aurora-Network-Global/sdg-queries">Aurora</a> network using the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corpustools/corpustools.pdf">corpustools</a> *R* package to detect whether titles or abstracts were SDG-relevant.  

#### Data
