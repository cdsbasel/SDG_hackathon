## Setup

The Center for Cognitive and Decision Sciences (CDS) coordinated a collaborative project involving several CDS members and MSc students associated with the center. The project consisted of a series of planning sessions and two collaborative [hackathons](hackathon.html).

**MSc Students**: Nina Frings, Sophia Prix, ...

**CDS Staff**: Alexandra Bagaini, Yun-Rui Liu, Samuel Aeschbach, ...

**Coordination**: Dirk Wulff, Rui Mata 

## Preliminaries

Participants clone this <a href="https://github.com/cdsbasel/SDG_hackathon"><b>Github repository</b></a>. 

## Part I - Visualizing (April 14th, 2021)

#### Goal

The goal of the first hackathon part is to produce three quality visualizations illustrating...

1. The frequency distribution of sustainable development goals detected in Unibas publications and projects. 
2. The relationship between sustainable development goals. 
3. The distribution of sustainable development goals detected in Unibas publications and projects as a function of Unibas organizational units. 

#### Rules

1. Each group creates and works in a single R script that is given a unique name by the group, e.g., a group pseudonym, to not infer with the other groups' script files. The script file is stored in `1_code`. See code template including the placeholder `GROUPPSEUDONYM`.
2. Each group creates three `.pdf` figure files in the `2_figures` folder. Figure files also must receive a suffix identifying the group. See example figure. 
3. Pull before you Push.

## Part II - Reporting (April 29th, 2021)

#### Goal

The goal of the second hackathon part is to produce a report based on the visualizations produced in the first hackathon. 

#### Rules

1. Each group creates and works in a single R Markdown document that is given a unique name by the group. 

2. Pull before you Push.
