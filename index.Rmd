This is the home of the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) CDS Hackathon**. 

The project is the result of a partnership between the [Sustainability Office](https://www.unibas.ch/en/University/Administration-Services/General-Secretariat/Sustainability/Team.html) and the [Center for Cognitive and Decision Sciences](https://psychologie.unibas.ch/de/fakultaet/abteilungen/cognitive-and-decision-sciences-305/) of the University of Basel aimed at obtaining an overview of the University of Basel's contributions to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
