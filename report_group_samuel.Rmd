# Introduction

In April 2021 the Center for Cognitive and Decision Science of the Unviversity of Basel conducted a UN Sustainability Development Goal Hackathon. The goal of this Hackathon was to identify to which sustainable development goals the research done by different organizational units contributes.

In order to so, Sustainable development goals were detected in research output with a querry based approach. aurora etc.

## Data

As the Hackathon was conducted as a request by the sustainability office of the University of Basel, the office provided a multiple databases containing information of the Universityâ€™s historical electronic research output.
Data was collected from the Research database, as well as from the Grants office database. Data contained not only publications made by researcher employed by the University of Basel but also projects (self funded and externally funded). 

`r toString(n_publications)` Articles were included, as well as `r toString(n_projects)`) projects. In total  `r toString(n_matches_publications)` matches fitting to the search querries were found in publications and `r toString(n_matches_projects)` were found in projects.  

## Methodological 

Only Publications and Projects that were published or completed from 2010 to 2020 were included.The Query search  

Query search using Aurora (Link). 
 
Conducted using corpustools R package and translations of the queries.

Choice of organizational unit

# Distribution of SDG
Text including numbers computed using inline code: No. articles (`r toString(n_publications)`), No. of projects (`r toString(n_projects)`), No. of matches (any SDG) in both (publications: `r toString(n_matches_publications)`; projects: `r toString(n_matches_projects)`).
