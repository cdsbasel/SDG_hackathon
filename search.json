About half of all publications remained.\nIdentified abstracts for all publications using rscopus. About ~85% of abstracts could be retrieved.\nPublications & Projects\nIdentified faculty-level organizational unit within the University of Basel (including associated and cross-disciplinary institutes) for each item.\nUsing translations of the SDG queries of the Aurora network and the corpustools R package, detected wether titles or abstracts were SDG-relevant.\nData\nThe data is shared via this Github repository.\nPublications columns\nVariable\nDescription\ntype\nType of publication.\nyear\nYear of publication.\nauthors\nAuthor list of publication.\ntitle\nTitle of publication.\nabstract\nAbstract of publication.\noutlet\nName of journal, book, or proceedings publication.\npeer_reviewed\nHas publication been subjected to peer review.\norganisation\nOriginal list of Unibas organizations involved in publication.\nunibas_authors\nPublication authors at University of Basel.\nunibas_publcation\nPublication offically affiliated with University of Basel.

The script file is stored in 1_code. See code template including the placeholder GROUPPSEUDONYM.\nEach group creates three .pdf figure files in the 2_figures folder. Figure files also must receive a suffix identifying the group. See example figure.\nPull before you Push.\nPart II - Reporting\ntba\n\n\n\n",
